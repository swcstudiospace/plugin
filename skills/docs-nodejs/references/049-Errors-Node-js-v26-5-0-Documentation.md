## Errors[#](#errors)

Applications running in Node.js will generally experience the following
categories of errors:

- Standard JavaScript errors such as [`<EvalError>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/EvalError), [`<SyntaxError>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError), [`<RangeError>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RangeError),
  [`<ReferenceError>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ReferenceError), [`<TypeError>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError), and [`<URIError>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/URIError).
- Standard `DOMException`s.
- System errors triggered by underlying operating system constraints such
  as attempting to open a file that does not exist or attempting to send data
  over a closed socket.
- `AssertionError`s are a special class of error that can be triggered when
  Node.js detects an exceptional logic violation that should never occur. These
  are raised typically by the `node:assert` module.
- User-specified errors triggered by application code.

All JavaScript and system errors raised by Node.js inherit from, or are
instances of, the standard JavaScript [`<Error>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) class and are guaranteed
to provide *at least* the properties available on that class.

The [`error.message`](#errormessage) property of errors raised by Node.js may be changed in
any versions. Use [`error.code`](#errorcode) to identify an error instead. For a
`DOMException`, use [`domException.name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMException/name) to identify its type.

### Error propagation and interception[#](#error-propagation-and-interception)

Node.js supports several mechanisms for propagating and handling errors that
occur while an application is running. How these errors are reported and
handled depends entirely on the type of `Error` and the style of the API that is
called.

All JavaScript errors are handled as exceptions that *immediately* generate
and throw an error using the standard JavaScript `throw` mechanism. These
are handled using the [`try…catch` construct](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) provided by the
JavaScript language.

```
// Throws with a ReferenceError because z is not defined.
try {
  const m = 1;
  const n = m + z;
} catch (err) {
  // Handle the error here.
}

jscopy
```

Any use of the JavaScript `throw` mechanism will raise an exception that
*must* be handled or the Node.js process will exit immediately.

With few exceptions, *Synchronous* APIs (any blocking method that does not
return a [`<Promise>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) nor accept a `callback` function, such as
[`fs.readFileSync`](fs.html#fsreadfilesyncpath-options)), will use `throw` to report errors.

Errors that occur within *Asynchronous APIs* may be reported in multiple ways:

- Some asynchronous methods returns a [`<Promise>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), you should always take into
  account that it might be rejected. See [`--unhandled-rejections`](cli.html#--unhandled-rejectionsmode) flag for
  how the process will react to an unhandled promise rejection.

  ```
  const fs = require('node:fs/promises');

  (async () => {
    let data;
    try {
      data = await fs.readFile('a file that does not exist');
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('There was an error reading the file!', err);
      return;
    }
    // Otherwise handle the data
  })();

  jscopy
  ```
- Most asynchronous methods that accept a `callback` function will accept an
  `Error` object passed as the first argument to that function. If that first
  argument is not `null` and is an instance of `Error`, then an error occurred
  that should be handled.

  ```
  const fs = require('node:fs');
  fs.readFile('a file that does not exist', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('There was an error reading the file!', err);
      return;
    }
    // Otherwise handle the data
  });

  jscopy
  ```
- When an asynchronous method is called on an object that is an
  [`EventEmitter`](events.html#class-eventemitter), errors can be routed to that object's `'error'` event.

  ```
  const net = require('node:net');
  const connection = net.connect('localhost');

  // Adding an 'error' event handler to a stream:
  connection.on('error', (err) => {
    // If the connection is reset by the server, or if it can't
    // connect at all, or on any sort of error encountered by
    // the connection, the error will be sent here.
    console.error(err);
  });

  connection.pipe(process.stdout);

  jscopy
  ```
- A handful of typically asynchronous methods in the Node.js API may still
  use the `throw` mechanism to raise exceptions that must be handled using
  `try…catch`. There is no comprehensive list of such methods; please
  refer to the documentation of each method to determine the appropriate
  error handling mechanism required.

The use of the `'error'` event mechanism is most common for [stream-based](stream.html)
and [event emitter-based](events.html#class-eventemitter) APIs, which themselves represent a series of
asynchronous operations over time (as opposed to a single operation that may
pass or fail).

For *all* [`EventEmitter`](events.html#class-eventemitter) objects, if an `'error'` event handler is not
provided, the error will be thrown, causing the Node.js process to report an
uncaught exception and crash unless either: a handler has been registered for
the [`'uncaughtException'`](process.html#event-uncaughtexception) event, or the deprecated [`node:domain`](domain.html)
module is used.

```
const EventEmitter = require('node:events');
const ee = new EventEmitter();

setImmediate(() => {
  // This will crash the process because no 'error' event
  // handler has been added.
  ee.emit('error', new Error('This will crash'));
});

jscopy
```

Errors generated in this way *cannot* be intercepted using `try…catch` as
they are thrown *after* the calling code has already exited.

Developers must refer to the documentation for each method to determine
exactly how errors raised by those methods are propagated.

### Class: `Error`[#](#class-error)

A generic JavaScript [`<Error>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object that does not denote any specific
circumstance of why the error occurred. `Error` objects capture a "stack trace"
detailing the point in the code at which the `Error` was instantiated, and may
provide a text description of the error.

All errors generated by Node.js, including all system and JavaScript errors,
will either be instances of, or inherit from, the `Error` class.

#### `new Error(message[, options])`[#](#new-errormessage-options)

- `message` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)
- `options` [`<Object>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
  - `cause` [`<any>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Data_types) The error that caused the newly created error.

Creates a new `Error` object and sets the `error.message` property to the
provided text message. If an object is passed as `message`, the text message
is generated by calling `String(message)`. If the `cause` option is provided,
it is assigned to the `error.cause` property. The `error.stack` property will
represent the point in the code at which `new Error()` was called. Stack traces
are dependent on [V8's stack trace API](https://v8.dev/docs/stack-trace-api). Stack traces extend only to either
(a) the beginning of *synchronous code execution*, or (b) the number of frames
given by the property `Error.stackTraceLimit`, whichever is smaller.

#### `Error.captureStackTrace(targetObject[, constructorOpt])`[#](#errorcapturestacktracetargetobject-constructoropt)

- `targetObject` [`<Object>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
- `constructorOpt` [`<Function>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)

Creates a `.stack` property on `targetObject`, which when accessed returns
a string representing the location in the code at which
`Error.captureStackTrace()` was called.

```
const myObject = {};
Error.captureStackTrace(myObject);
myObject.stack;  // Similar to `new Error().stack`

jscopy
```

The first line of the trace will be prefixed with
`${myObject.name}: ${myObject.message}`.

The optional `constructorOpt` argument accepts a function. If given, all frames
above `constructorOpt`, including `constructorOpt`, will be omitted from the
generated stack trace.

The `constructorOpt` argument is useful for hiding implementation
details of error generation from the user. For instance:

```
function a() {
  b();
}

function b() {
  c();
}

function c() {
  // Create an error without stack trace to avoid calculating the stack trace twice.
  const { stackTraceLimit } = Error;
  Error.stackTraceLimit = 0;
  const error = new Error();
  Error.stackTraceLimit = stackTraceLimit;

  // Capture the stack trace above function b
  Error.captureStackTrace(error, b); // Neither function c, nor b is included in the stack trace
  throw error;
}

a();

jscopy
```

#### `Error.stackTraceLimit`[#](#errorstacktracelimit)

- Type: [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type)

The `Error.stackTraceLimit` property specifies the number of stack frames
collected by a stack trace (whether generated by `new Error().stack` or
`Error.captureStackTrace(obj)`).

The default value is `10` but may be set to any valid JavaScript number. Changes
will affect any stack trace captured *after* the value has been changed.

If set to a non-number value, or set to a negative number, stack traces will
not capture any frames.

#### `error.cause`[#](#errorcause)

Added in: v16.9.0

- Type: [`<any>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Data_types)

If present, the `error.cause` property is the underlying cause of the `Error`.
It is used when catching an error and throwing a new one with a different
message or code in order to still have access to the original error.

The `error.cause` property is typically set by calling
`new Error(message, { cause })`. It is not set by the constructor if the
`cause` option is not provided.

This property allows errors to be chained. When serializing `Error` objects,
[`util.inspect()`](util.html#utilinspectobject-options) recursively serializes `error.cause` if it is set.

```
const cause = new Error('The remote HTTP server responded with a 500 status');
const symptom = new Error('The message failed to send', { cause });

console.log(symptom);
// Prints:
//   Error: The message failed to send
//       at REPL2:1:17
//       at Script.runInThisContext (node:vm:130:12)
//       ... 7 lines matching cause stack trace ...
//       at [_line] [as _line] (node:internal/readline/interface:886:18) {
//     [cause]: Error: The remote HTTP server responded with a 500 status
//         at REPL1:1:15
//         at Script.runInThisContext (node:vm:130:12)
//         at REPLServer.defaultEval (node:repl:574:29)
//         at bound (node:domain:426:15)
//         at REPLServer.runBound [as eval] (node:domain:437:12)
//         at REPLServer.onLine (node:repl:902:10)
//         at REPLServer.emit (node:events:549:35)
//         at REPLServer.emit (node:domain:482:12)
//         at [_onLine] [as _onLine] (node:internal/readline/interface:425:12)
//         at [_line] [as _line] (node:internal/readline/interface:886:18)

jscopy
```

#### `error.code`[#](#errorcode)

- Type: [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

The `error.code` property is a string label that identifies the kind of error.
`error.code` is the most stable way to identify an error. It will only change
between major versions of Node.js. In contrast, `error.message` strings may
change between any versions of Node.js. See [Node.js error codes](#nodejs-error-codes) for details
about specific codes.

#### `error.message`[#](#errormessage)

- Type: [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

The `error.message` property is the string description of the error as set by
calling `new Error(message)`. The `message` passed to the constructor will also
appear in the first line of the stack trace of the `Error`, however changing
this property after the `Error` object is created *may not* change the first
line of the stack trace (for example, when `error.stack` is read before this
property is changed).

```
const err = new Error('The message');
console.error(err.message);
// Prints: The message

jscopy
```

#### `error.stack`[#](#errorstack)

- Type: [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

The `error.stack` property is a string describing the point in the code at which
the `Error` was instantiated.

```
Error: Things keep happening!
   at /home/gbusey/file.js:525:2
   at Frobnicator.refrobulate (/home/gbusey/business-logic.js:424:21)
   at Actor.<anonymous> (/home/gbusey/actors.js:400:8)
   at increaseSynergy (/home/gbusey/actors.js:701:6)

consolecopy
```

The first line is formatted as `<error class name>: <error message>`, and
is followed by a series of stack frames (each line beginning with "at ").
Each frame describes a call site within the code that lead to the error being
generated. V8 attempts to display a name for each function (by variable name,
function name, or object method name), but occasionally it will not be able to
find a suitable name. If V8 cannot determine a name for the function, only
location information will be displayed for that frame. Otherwise, the
determined function name will be displayed with location information appended
in parentheses.

Frames are only generated for JavaScript functions. If, for example, execution
synchronously passes through a C++ addon function called `cheetahify` which
itself calls a JavaScript function, the frame representing the `cheetahify` call
will not be present in the stack traces:

```
const cheetahify = require('./native-binding.node');

function makeFaster() {
  // `cheetahify()` *synchronously* calls speedy.
  cheetahify(function speedy() {
    throw new Error('oh no!');
  });
}

makeFaster();
// will throw:
//   /home/gbusey/file.js:6
//       throw new Error('oh no!');
//           ^
//   Error: oh no!
//       at speedy (/home/gbusey/file.js:6:11)
//       at makeFaster (/home/gbusey/file.js:5:3)
//       at Object.<anonymous> (/home/gbusey/file.js:10:1)
//       at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)
//       at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)
//       at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
//       at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)
//       at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)
//       at startup (node.js:119:16)
//       at node.js:906:3

jscopy
```

The location information will be one of:

- `native`, if the frame represents a call internal to V8 (as in `[].forEach`).
- `plain-filename.js:line:column`, if the frame represents a call internal
  to Node.js.
- `/absolute/path/to/file.js:line:column`, if the frame represents a call in
  a user program (using CommonJS module system), or its dependencies.
- `<transport-protocol>:///url/to/module/file.mjs:line:column`, if the frame
  represents a call in a user program (using ES module system), or
  its dependencies.

The number of frames captured by the stack trace is bounded by the smaller of
`Error.stackTraceLimit` or the number of available frames on the current event
loop tick.

`error.stack` is a getter/setter for a hidden internal property which is only
present on builtin `Error` objects (those for which [`Error.isError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/isError) returns
true). If `error` is not a builtin error object, then the `error.stack` getter
will always return `undefined`, and the setter will do nothing. This can occur
if the accessor is manually invoked with a `this` value that is not a builtin
error object, such as a [`<Proxy>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy).

### Class: `AssertionError`[#](#class-assertionerror)

- Extends: [`<errors.Error>`](errors.html#class-errorserror)

Indicates the failure of an assertion. For details, see
[`Class: assert.AssertionError`](assert.html#class-assertassertionerror).

### Class: `RangeError`[#](#class-rangeerror)

- Extends: [`<errors.Error>`](errors.html#class-errorserror)

Indicates that a provided argument was not within the set or range of
acceptable values for a function; whether that is a numeric range, or
outside the set of options for a given function parameter.

```
require('node:net').connect(-1);
// Throws "RangeError: "port" option should be >= 0 and < 65536: -1"

jscopy
```

Node.js will generate and throw `RangeError` instances *immediately* as a form
of argument validation.

### Class: `ReferenceError`[#](#class-referenceerror)

- Extends: [`<errors.Error>`](errors.html#class-errorserror)

Indicates that an attempt is being made to access a variable that is not
defined. Such errors commonly indicate typos in code, or an otherwise broken
program.

While client code may generate and propagate these errors, in practice, only V8
will do so.

```
doesNotExist;
// Throws ReferenceError, doesNotExist is not a variable in this program.

jscopy
```

Unless an application is dynamically generating and running code,
`ReferenceError` instances indicate a bug in the code or its dependencies.

### Class: `SyntaxError`[#](#class-syntaxerror)

- Extends: [`<errors.Error>`](errors.html#class-errorserror)

Indicates that a program is not valid JavaScript. These errors may only be
generated and propagated as a result of code evaluation. Code evaluation may
happen as a result of `eval`, `Function`, `require`, or [vm](vm.html). These errors
are almost always indicative of a broken program.

```
try {
  require('node:vm').runInThisContext('binary ! isNotOk');
} catch (err) {
  // 'err' will be a SyntaxError.
}

jscopy
```

`SyntaxError` instances are unrecoverable in the context that created them –
they may only be caught by other contexts.

### Class: `SystemError`[#](#class-systemerror)

- Extends: [`<errors.Error>`](errors.html#class-errorserror)

Node.js generates system errors when exceptions occur within its runtime
environment. These usually occur when an application violates an operating
system constraint. For example, a system error will occur if an application
attempts to read a file that does not exist.

- `address` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) If present, the address to which a network connection
  failed
- `code` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) The string error code
- `dest` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) If present, the file path destination when reporting a file
  system error
- `errno` [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type) The system-provided error number
- `info` [`<Object>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) If present, extra details about the error condition
- `message` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) A system-provided human-readable description of the error
- `path` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) If present, the file path when reporting a file system error
- `port` [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type) If present, the network connection port that is not available
- `syscall` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) The name of the system call that triggered the error

#### `error.address`[#](#erroraddress)

- Type: [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

If present, `error.address` is a string describing the address to which a
network connection failed.

#### `error.code`[#](#errorcode-1)

- Type: [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

The `error.code` property is a string representing the error code.

#### `error.dest`[#](#errordest)

- Type: [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

If present, `error.dest` is the file path destination when reporting a file
system error.

#### `error.errno`[#](#errorerrno)

- Type: [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type)

The `error.errno` property is a negative number which corresponds
to the error code defined in [`libuv Error handling`](https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/errors.html).

On Windows the error number provided by the system will be normalized by libuv.

To get the string representation of the error code, use
[`util.getSystemErrorName(error.errno)`](util.html#utilgetsystemerrornameerr).

#### `error.info`[#](#errorinfo)

- Type: [`<Object>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

If present, `error.info` is an object with details about the error condition.

#### `error.message`[#](#errormessage-1)

- Type: [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

`error.message` is a system-provided human-readable description of the error.

#### `error.path`[#](#errorpath)

- Type: [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

If present, `error.path` is a string containing a relevant invalid pathname.

#### `error.port`[#](#errorport)

- Type: [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type)

If present, `error.port` is the network connection port that is not available.

#### `error.syscall`[#](#errorsyscall)

- Type: [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

The `error.syscall` property is a string describing the [syscall](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html) that failed.

#### Common system errors[#](#common-system-errors)

This is a list of system errors commonly-encountered when writing a Node.js
program. For a comprehensive list, see the [`errno`(3) man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html).

- `EACCES` (Permission denied): An attempt was made to access a file in a way
  forbidden by its file access permissions.
- `EADDRINUSE` (Address already in use): An attempt to bind a server
  ([`net`](net.html), [`http`](http.html), or [`https`](https.html)) to a local address failed due to
  another server on the local system already occupying that address.
- `ECONNREFUSED` (Connection refused): No connection could be made because the
  target machine actively refused it. This usually results from trying to
  connect to a service that is inactive on the foreign host.
- `ECONNRESET` (Connection reset by peer): A connection was forcibly closed by
  a peer. This normally results from a loss of the connection on the remote
  socket due to a timeout or reboot. Commonly encountered via the [`http`](http.html)
  and [`net`](net.html) modules.
- `EEXIST` (File exists): An existing file was the target of an operation that
  required that the target not exist.
- `EISDIR` (Is a directory): An operation expected a file, but the given
  pathname was a directory.
- `EMFILE` (Too many open files in system): Maximum number of
  [file descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor) allowable on the system has been reached, and
  requests for another descriptor cannot be fulfilled until at least one
  has been closed. This is encountered when opening many files at once in
  parallel, especially on systems (in particular, macOS) where there is a low
  file descriptor limit for processes. To remedy a low limit, run
  `ulimit -n 2048` in the same shell that will run the Node.js process.
- `ENOENT` (No such file or directory): Commonly raised by [`fs`](fs.html) operations
  to indicate that a component of the specified pathname does not exist. No
  entity (file or directory) could be found by the given path.
- `ENOTDIR` (Not a directory): A component of the given pathname existed, but
  was not a directory as expected. Commonly raised by [`fs.readdir`](fs.html#fsreaddirpath-options-callback).
- `ENOTEMPTY` (Directory not empty): A directory with entries was the target
  of an operation that requires an empty directory, usually [`fs.unlink`](fs.html#fsunlinkpath-callback).
- `ENOTFOUND` (DNS lookup failed): Indicates a DNS failure of either
  `EAI_NODATA` or `EAI_NONAME`. This is not a standard POSIX error.
- `EPERM` (Operation not permitted): An attempt was made to perform an
  operation that requires elevated privileges.
- `EPIPE` (Broken pipe): A write on a pipe, socket, or FIFO for which there is
  no process to read the data. Commonly encountered at the [`net`](net.html) and
  [`http`](http.html) layers, indicative that the remote side of the stream being
  written to has been closed.
- `ETIMEDOUT` (Operation timed out): A connect or send request failed because
  the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time. Usually
  encountered by [`http`](http.html) or [`net`](net.html). Often a sign that a `socket.end()`
  was not properly called.

### Class: `TypeError`[#](#class-typeerror)

- Extends [`<errors.Error>`](errors.html#class-errorserror)

Indicates that a provided argument is not an allowable type. For example,
passing a function to a parameter which expects a string would be a `TypeError`.

```
require('node:url').parse(() => { });
// Throws TypeError, since it expected a string.

jscopy
```

Node.js will generate and throw `TypeError` instances *immediately* as a form
of argument validation.

### Exceptions vs. errors[#](#exceptions-vs-errors)

A JavaScript exception is a value that is thrown as a result of an invalid
operation or as the target of a `throw` statement. While it is not required
that these values are instances of `Error` or classes which inherit from
`Error`, all exceptions thrown by Node.js or the JavaScript runtime *will* be
instances of `Error`.

Some exceptions are *unrecoverable* at the JavaScript layer. Such exceptions
will *always* cause the Node.js process to crash. Examples include `assert()`
checks or `abort()` calls in the C++ layer.

### OpenSSL errors[#](#openssl-errors)

Errors originating in `crypto` or `tls` are of class `Error`, and in addition to
the standard `.code` and `.message` properties, may have some additional
OpenSSL-specific properties.

#### `error.opensslErrorStack`[#](#erroropensslerrorstack)

An array of errors that can give context to where in the OpenSSL library an
error originates from.

#### `error.function`[#](#errorfunction)

The OpenSSL function the error originates in.

#### `error.library`[#](#errorlibrary)

A special type of error that is triggered whenever Node.js tries to get access
to a resource restricted by the [Permission Model](permissions.html#permission-model).

#### `ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ARGUMENT`[#](#err_ambiguous_argument)

A function argument is being used in a way that suggests that the function
signature may be misunderstood. This is thrown by the `node:assert` module when
the `message` parameter in `assert.throws(block, message)` matches the error
message thrown by `block` because that usage suggests that the user believes
`message` is the expected message rather than the message the `AssertionError`
will display if `block` does not throw.

#### `ERR_ARG_NOT_ITERABLE`[#](#err_arg_not_iterable)

An iterable argument (i.e. a value that works with `for...of` loops) was
required, but not provided to a Node.js API.

code, while in a JS engine Context that is not associated with a Node.js
instance. The data passed to the `Buffer` method will have been released
by the time the method returns.

When encountering this error, a possible alternative to creating a `Buffer`
instance is to create a normal `Uint8Array`, which only differs in the
prototype of the resulting object. `Uint8Array`s are generally accepted in all
Node.js core APIs where `Buffer`s are; they are available in all Contexts.

situation can only occur on Unix-like systems where only `localhost` or an empty
host is supported.

#### `ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH`[#](#err_invalid_file_url_path)

A Node.js API that consumes `file:` URLs (such as certain functions in the
[`fs`](fs.html) module) encountered a file URL with an incompatible path. The exact
semantics for determining whether a path can be used is platform-dependent.

The thrown error object includes an `input` property that contains the URL object
of the invalid `file:` URL.

#### `ERR_INVALID_HANDLE_TYPE`[#](#err_invalid_handle_type)

An attempt was made to send an unsupported "handle" over an IPC communication
channel to a child process. See [`subprocess.send()`](child_process.html#subprocesssendmessage-sendhandle-options-callback) and [`process.send()`](process.html#processsendmessage-sendhandle-options-callback)

represent a `[name, value]` tuple – that is, if an element is not iterable, or
does not consist of exactly two elements.

#### `ERR_INVALID_TYPESCRIPT_SYNTAX`[#](#err_invalid_typescript_syntax)

Added in: v23.0.0, v22.10.0History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v23.7.0, v22.14.0 | This error is no longer thrown on valid yet unsupported syntax. |

The provided TypeScript syntax is not valid.

#### `ERR_INVALID_URI`[#](#err_invalid_uri)

An invalid URI was passed.

#### `ERR_INVALID_URL`[#](#err_invalid_url)

An invalid URL was passed to the [WHATWG](url.html#the-whatwg-url-api) [`URL`
constructor](url.html#new-urlinput-base) or the legacy [`url.parse()`](url.html#urlparseurlstring-parsequerystring-slashesdenotehost) to be parsed.
The thrown error object typically has an additional property `'input'` that
contains the URL that failed to parse.

#### `ERR_INVALID_URL_PATTERN`[#](#err_invalid_url_pattern)

An invalid URLPattern was passed to the [WHATWG](url.html#the-whatwg-url-api)
[`URLPattern` constructor](url.html#new-urlpatternstring-baseurl-options) to be parsed.

#### `ERR_INVALID_URL_SCHEME`[#](#err_invalid_url_scheme)

An attempt was made to use a URL of an incompatible scheme (protocol) for a
specific purpose. It is only used in the [WHATWG URL API](url.html#the-whatwg-url-api) support in the
[`fs`](fs.html) module (which only accepts URLs with `'file'` scheme), but may be used
in other Node.js APIs as well in the future.

#### `ERR_IPC_CHANNEL_CLOSED`[#](#err_ipc_channel_closed)

An attempt was made to use an IPC communication channel that was already closed.

#### `ERR_IPC_DISCONNECTED`[#](#err_ipc_disconnected)

disconnected. See the documentation for the [`child_process`](child_process.html) module
for more information.

#### `ERR_IPC_ONE_PIPE`[#](#err_ipc_one_pipe)

An attempt was made to create a child Node.js process using more than one IPC
communication channel. See the documentation for the [`child_process`](child_process.html) module
for more information.

#### `ERR_IPC_SYNC_FORK`[#](#err_ipc_sync_fork)

An attempt was made to open an IPC communication channel with a synchronously
forked Node.js process. See the documentation for the [`child_process`](child_process.html) module
for more information.

#### `ERR_IP_BLOCKED`[#](#err_ip_blocked)

IP is blocked by `net.BlockList`.

#### `ERR_LOADER_CHAIN_INCOMPLETE`[#](#err_loader_chain_incomplete)

Added in: v18.6.0, v16.17.0

An ESM loader hook returned without calling `next()` and without explicitly
signaling a short circuit.

#### `ERR_LOAD_SQLITE_EXTENSION`[#](#err_load_sqlite_extension)

Added in: v23.5.0, v22.13.0

An error occurred while loading a SQLite extension.

#### `ERR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_FAILED`[#](#err_memory_allocation_failed)

An attempt was made to allocate memory (usually in the C++ layer) but it
failed.

#### `ERR_MESSAGE_TARGET_CONTEXT_UNAVAILABLE`

Added in: v14.5.0, v12.19.0

A message posted to a [`MessagePort`](worker_threads.html#class-messageport) could not be deserialized in the target
[vm](vm.html) `Context`. Not all Node.js objects can be successfully instantiated in
any context at this time, and attempting to transfer them using `postMessage()`
can fail on the receiving side in that case.

#### `ERR_METHOD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`[#](#err_method_not_implemented)

A method is required but not implemented.

#### `ERR_MISSING_ARGS`[#](#err_missing_args)

A required argument of a Node.js API was not passed. This is only used for
strict compliance with the API specification (which in some cases may accept
`func(undefined)` but not `func()`). In most native Node.js APIs,
`func(undefined)` and `func()` are treated identically, and the
[`ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE`](#err_invalid_arg_type) error code may be used instead.

#### `ERR_MISSING_OPTION`[#](#err_missing_option)

For APIs that accept options objects, some options might be mandatory. This code
is thrown if a required option is missing.

#### `ERR_MISSING_PASSPHRASE`[#](#err_missing_passphrase)

An attempt was made to read an encrypted key without specifying a passphrase.

#### `ERR_MISSING_PLATFORM_FOR_WORKER`[#](#err_missing_platform_for_worker)

The V8 platform used by this instance of Node.js does not support creating
Workers. This is caused by lack of embedder support for Workers. In particular,
this error will not occur with standard builds of Node.js.

#### `ERR_MODULE_LINK_MISMATCH`[#](#err_module_link_mismatch)

A module can not be linked because the same module requests in it are not
resolved to the same module.

#### `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`[#](#err_module_not_found)

A module file could not be resolved by the ECMAScript modules loader while
attempting an `import` operation or when loading the program entry point.

#### `ERR_MULTIPLE_CALLBACK`[#](#err_multiple_callback)

A callback was called more than once.

A callback is almost always meant to only be called once as the query
can either be fulfilled or rejected but not both at the same time. The latter
would be possible by calling a callback more than once.

#### `ERR_NAPI_CONS_FUNCTION`[#](#err_napi_cons_function)

While using `Node-API`, a constructor passed was not a function.

#### `ERR_NAPI_INVALID_DATAVIEW_ARGS`[#](#err_napi_invalid_dataview_args)

While calling `napi_create_dataview()`, a given `offset` was outside the bounds
of the dataview or `offset + length` was larger than a length of given `buffer`.

#### `ERR_NAPI_INVALID_TYPEDARRAY_ALIGNMENT`[#](#err_napi_invalid_typedarray_alignment)

While calling `napi_create_typedarray()`, the provided `offset` was not a
multiple of the element size.

#### `ERR_NAPI_INVALID_TYPEDARRAY_LENGTH`[#](#err_napi_invalid_typedarray_length)

While calling `napi_create_typedarray()`, `(length * size_of_element) + byte_offset` was larger than the length of given `buffer`.

#### `ERR_NAPI_TSFN_CALL_JS`[#](#err_napi_tsfn_call_js)

An error occurred while invoking the JavaScript portion of the thread-safe
function.

#### `ERR_NAPI_TSFN_GET_UNDEFINED`[#](#err_napi_tsfn_get_undefined)

An error occurred while attempting to retrieve the JavaScript `undefined`
value.

#### `ERR_NON_CONTEXT_AWARE_DISABLED`[#](#err_non_context_aware_disabled)

A non-context-aware native addon was loaded in a process that disallows them.

#### `ERR_NOT_BUILDING_SNAPSHOT`[#](#err_not_building_snapshot)

An attempt was made to use operations that can only be used when building
V8 startup snapshot even though Node.js isn't building one.

#### `ERR_NOT_IN_SINGLE_EXECUTABLE_APPLICATION`[#](#err_not_in_single_executable_application)

Added in: v21.7.0, v20.12.0

The operation cannot be performed when it's not in a single-executable
application.

#### `ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED_IN_SNAPSHOT`[#](#err_not_supported_in_snapshot)

An attempt was made to perform operations that are not supported when
building a startup snapshot.

#### `ERR_NO_CRYPTO`[#](#err_no_crypto)

An attempt was made to use crypto features while Node.js was not compiled with
OpenSSL crypto support.

#### `ERR_NO_ICU`[#](#err_no_icu)

An attempt was made to use features that require [ICU](intl.html#internationalization-support), but Node.js was not
compiled with ICU support.

#### `ERR_NO_TEMPORAL`[#](#err_no_temporal)

Added in: v26.2.0

An attempt was made to use features that require [`Temporal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal), but Node.js was not
compiled with `Temporal` support or it has been disabled in the current environment
(for example, when running with `--no-harmony-temporal`).

#### `ERR_NO_TYPESCRIPT`[#](#err_no_typescript)

Added in: v23.0.0, v22.12.0

An attempt was made to use features that require [Native TypeScript support](typescript.html#type-stripping), but Node.js was not
compiled with TypeScript support.

#### `ERR_OPERATION_FAILED`[#](#err_operation_failed)

Added in: v15.0.0

An operation failed. This is typically used to signal the general failure
of an asynchronous operation.

#### `ERR_OPTIONS_BEFORE_BOOTSTRAPPING`[#](#err_options_before_bootstrapping)

Added in: v23.10.0, v22.16.0

An attempt was made to get options before the bootstrapping was completed.

#### `ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE`[#](#err_out_of_range)

A given value is out of the accepted range.

#### `ERR_PACKAGE_IMPORT_NOT_DEFINED`[#](#err_package_import_not_defined)

The `package.json` [`"imports"`](packages.html#imports) field does not define the given internal
package specifier mapping.

#### `ERR_PACKAGE_MAP_EXTERNAL_FILE`[#](#err_package_map_external_file)

Added in: v26.4.0

A module attempted to resolve a bare specifier using the [package map](packages.html#package-maps), but
the importing file is not located within any package defined in the map.

```
$ node --experimental-package-map=./package-map.json /tmp/script.js
Error [ERR_PACKAGE_MAP_EXTERNAL_FILE]: Cannot resolve "dep-a" from "/tmp/script.js": file is not within any package defined in /path/to/package-map.json

consolecopy
```

To fix this error, ensure the importing file is inside one of the package
directories listed in the package map, or add a new package entry whose `url`
covers the importing file.

#### `ERR_PACKAGE_MAP_INVALID`[#](#err_package_map_invalid)

Added in: v26.4.0

The [package map](packages.html#package-maps) configuration file is invalid. This can occur when:

- The file does not exist at the specified path.
- The file contains invalid JSON.
- The file is missing the required `packages` object.
- A package entry is missing the required `url` field.
- Two package entries have the same `url` value.

```
$ node --experimental-package-map=./missing.json app.js
Error [ERR_PACKAGE_MAP_INVALID]: Invalid package map at "./missing.json": file not found

consolecopy
```

#### `ERR_PACKAGE_MAP_KEY_NOT_FOUND`[#](#err_package_map_key_not_found)

Added in: v26.4.0

A package's `dependencies` object in the [package map](packages.html#package-maps) references a package
key that is not defined in the `packages` object.

```
{
  "packages": {
    "app": {
      "url": "./app",
      "dependencies": {
        "foo": "nonexistent"
      }
    }
  }
}

jsoncopy
```

In this example, `"nonexistent"` is referenced as a dependency target but not
defined in `packages`, which will throw this error.

To fix this error, ensure all package keys referenced in `dependencies` values
are defined in the `packages` object.

#### `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`[#](#err_package_path_not_exported)

The `package.json` [`"exports"`](packages.html#exports) field does not export the requested subpath.
Because exports are encapsulated, private internal modules that are not exported
cannot be imported through the package resolution, unless using an absolute URL.

#### `ERR_PARSE_ARGS_INVALID_OPTION_VALUE`[#](#err_parse_args_invalid_option_value)

Added in: v18.3.0, v16.17.0

When `strict` set to `true`, thrown by [`util.parseArgs()`](util.html#utilparseargsconfig) if a [`<boolean>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#boolean_type)
value is provided for an option of type [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type), or if a [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)

An invalid timestamp value was provided for a performance mark or measure.

#### `ERR_PERFORMANCE_MEASURE_INVALID_OPTIONS`[#](#err_performance_measure_invalid_options)

Invalid options were provided for a performance measure.

#### `ERR_PROTO_ACCESS`[#](#err_proto_access)

Accessing `Object.prototype.__proto__` has been forbidden using
[`--disable-proto=throw`](cli.html#--disable-protomode). [`Object.getPrototypeOf`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getPrototypeOf) and
[`Object.setPrototypeOf`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/setPrototypeOf) should be used to get and set the prototype of an
object.

#### `ERR_PROXY_INVALID_CONFIG`[#](#err_proxy_invalid_config)

Failed to proxy a request because the proxy configuration is invalid.

#### `ERR_PROXY_TUNNEL`[#](#err_proxy_tunnel)

#### `ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE`[#](#err_require_async_module)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v26.5.0 | Added the `requireStack` and `topLevelAwaitLocations` properties. |

When trying to `require()` a [ES Module](esm.html), the module turns out to be asynchronous.
That is, it contains top-level await.

When uncaught, the flag `--experimental-print-required-tla` prints
the locations of the top-level awaits in the graph to stderr.

This error has the following additional non-enumerable properties:

- `requireStack` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)[] The chain of modules that led to the failing `require()`, starting with the module that required the asynchronous module.
- `topLevelAwaitLocations` [`<Object>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)[] The locations of the top-level awaits in
  the graph. Only populated when `--experimental-print-required-tla` is enabled.
  Each entry has the following properties:
  - `url` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) The URL of the module containing the top-level await.
  - `line` [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type) The 1-based line number of the top-level await.
  - `column` [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type) The 1-based column number of the top-level await.
  - `sourceLine` [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) The source line containing the top-level await.

#### `ERR_REQUIRE_CYCLE_MODULE`[#](#err_require_cycle_module)

When trying to `require()` a [ES Module](esm.html), a CommonJS to ESM or ESM to CommonJS edge
participates in an immediate cycle.
This is not allowed because ES Modules cannot be evaluated while they are
already being evaluated.

To avoid the cycle, the `require()` call involved in a cycle should not happen
at the top-level of either an ES Module (via `createRequire()`) or a CommonJS
module, and should be done lazily in an inner function.

#### `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`[#](#err_require_esm)

Stability: 0 - Deprecated

An attempt was made to `require()` an [ES Module](esm.html).

This error has been deprecated since `require()` now supports loading synchronous
ES modules. When `require()` encounters an ES module that contains top-level
`await`, it will throw [`ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE`](#err_require_async_module) instead.

The [`server.close()`](net.html#serverclosecallback) method was called when a `net.Server` was not
running. This applies to all instances of `net.Server`, including HTTP, HTTPS,
and HTTP/2 `Server` instances.

#### `ERR_SINGLE_EXECUTABLE_APPLICATION_ASSET_NOT_FOUND`[#](#err_single_executable_application_asset_not_found)

Added in: v21.7.0, v20.12.0

This error is thrown when an `ALPNCallback` returns a value that is not in the
list of ALPN protocols offered by the client.

#### `ERR_TLS_ALPN_CALLBACK_WITH_PROTOCOLS`

This error is thrown when creating a `TLSServer` if the TLS options include
both `ALPNProtocols` and `ALPNCallback`. These options are mutually exclusive.

#### `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_FORMAT`[#](#err_tls_cert_altname_format)

This error is thrown by `checkServerIdentity` if a user-supplied
`subjectaltname` property violates encoding rules. Certificate objects produced
by Node.js itself always comply with encoding rules and will never cause
this error.

#### `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID`[#](#err_tls_cert_altname_invalid)

While using TLS, the host name/IP of the peer did not match any of the
`subjectAltNames` in its certificate.

#### `ERR_TLS_DH_PARAM_SIZE`[#](#err_tls_dh_param_size)

While using TLS, the parameter offered for the Diffie-Hellman (`DH`)
key-agreement protocol is too small. By default, the key length must be greater
than or equal to 1024 bits to avoid vulnerabilities, even though it is strongly
recommended to use 2048 bits or larger for stronger security.

disabled because it is insecure.

#### `ERR_TLS_INVALID_PROTOCOL_VERSION`

Valid TLS protocol versions are `'TLSv1'`, `'TLSv1.1'`, or `'TLSv1.2'`.

#### `ERR_TLS_INVALID_STATE`[#](#err_tls_invalid_state)

Added in: v13.10.0, v12.17.0

The TLS socket must be connected and securely established. Ensure the 'secure'
event is emitted before continuing.

#### `ERR_TLS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_CONFLICT`

Attempting to set a TLS protocol `minVersion` or `maxVersion` conflicts with an
attempt to set the `secureProtocol` explicitly. Use one mechanism or the other.

support caller-initiated renegotiation.

#### `ERR_TLS_REQUIRED_SERVER_NAME`[#](#err_tls_required_server_name)

While using TLS, the `server.addContext()` method was called without providing
a host name in the first parameter.

#### `ERR_TLS_SESSION_ATTACK`[#](#err_tls_session_attack)

An excessive amount of TLS renegotiations is detected, which is a potential
vector for denial-of-service attacks.

#### `ERR_TLS_SNI_FROM_SERVER`[#](#err_tls_sni_from_server)

An attempt was made to issue Server Name Indication from a TLS server-side
socket, which is only valid from a client.

The `trace_events.createTracing()` method requires at least one trace event
category.

#### `ERR_TRACE_EVENTS_UNAVAILABLE`

The `node:trace_events` module could not be loaded because Node.js was compiled
with the `--without-v8-platform` flag.

#### `ERR_TRAILING_JUNK_AFTER_STREAM_END`[#](#err_trailing_junk_after_stream_end)

Trailing junk found after the end of the compressed stream.
This error is thrown when extra, unexpected data is detected
after the end of a compressed stream (for example, in zlib

A string that contained unescaped characters was received.

#### `ERR_UNHANDLED_ERROR`[#](#err_unhandled_error)

An unhandled error occurred (for instance, when an `'error'` event is emitted
by an [`EventEmitter`](events.html#class-eventemitter) but an `'error'` handler is not registered).

#### `ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE`[#](#err_unknown_builtin_module)

Used to identify a specific kind of internal Node.js error that should not
typically be triggered by user code. Instances of this error point to an
internal bug within the Node.js binary itself.

Added in: v22.6.0

Type stripping is not supported for files descendent of a `node_modules` directory.

#### `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_RESOLVE_REQUEST`[#](#err_unsupported_resolve_request)

An attempt was made to resolve an invalid module referrer. This can happen when
importing or calling `import.meta.resolve()` with either:

- a bare specifier that is not a builtin module from a module whose URL scheme
  is not `file`.
- a [relative URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#relative-url-string) from a module whose URL scheme is not a [special scheme](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#special-scheme).

```
try {
  // Trying to import the package 'bare-specifier' from a `data:` URL module:
  await import('data:text/javascript,import "bare-specifier"');
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.code); // ERR_UNSUPPORTED_RESOLVE_REQUEST
}

then an `Error` with this code will be emitted.

#### `HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW`

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v11.4.0, v10.15.0 | Max header size in `http_parser` was set to 8 KiB. |

Too much HTTP header data was received. In order to protect against malicious or
malconfigured clients, if more than `maxHeaderSize` of HTTP header data is received then
HTTP parsing will abort without a request or response object being created, and
an `Error` with this code will be emitted.

#### `HPE_UNEXPECTED_CONTENT_LENGTH`[#](#hpe_unexpected_content_length)

Server is sending both a `Content-Length` header and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.

`Transfer-Encoding: chunked` allows the server to maintain an HTTP persistent
connection for dynamically generated content.

attempting a [`require()`](modules.html#requireid) operation or when loading the program entry point.

### Legacy Node.js error codes[#](#legacy-nodejs-error-codes)

Stability: 0 - Deprecated. These error codes are either inconsistent, or have
been removed.

#### `ERR_CANNOT_TRANSFER_OBJECT`[#](#err_cannot_transfer_object)

#### `ERR_CRYPTO_HASH_DIGEST_NO_UTF16`[#](#err_crypto_hash_digest_no_utf16)

Added in: v9.0.0Removed in: v12.12.0

The UTF-16 encoding was used with [`hash.digest()`](crypto.html#hashdigestencoding). While the
`hash.digest()` method does allow an `encoding` argument to be passed in,
causing the method to return a string rather than a `Buffer`, the UTF-16
encoding (e.g. `ucs` or `utf16le`) is not supported.

#### `ERR_CRYPTO_SCRYPT_INVALID_PARAMETER`[#](#err_crypto_scrypt_invalid_parameter)

Removed in: v23.0.0

An incompatible combination of options was passed to [`crypto.scrypt()`](crypto.html#cryptoscryptpassword-salt-keylen-options-callback) or
[`crypto.scryptSync()`](crypto.html#cryptoscryptsyncpassword-salt-keylen-options). New versions of Node.js use the error code
[`ERR_INCOMPATIBLE_OPTION_PAIR`](#err_incompatible_option_pair) instead, which is consistent with other APIs.

#### `ERR_FS_INVALID_SYMLINK_TYPE`[#](#err_fs_invalid_symlink_type)

Removed in: v23.0.0

| v21.0.0 | A `DOMException` is thrown instead. |

An invalid transfer object was passed to `postMessage()`.

#### `ERR_MANIFEST_ASSERT_INTEGRITY`[#](#err_manifest_assert_integrity)

Removed in: v22.2.0

An attempt was made to load a resource, but the resource did not match the
integrity defined by the policy manifest. See the documentation for policy
manifests for more information.

#### `ERR_MANIFEST_DEPENDENCY_MISSING`[#](#err_manifest_dependency_missing)

Removed in: v22.2.0

An attempt was made to load a resource, but the resource was not listed as a
dependency from the location that attempted to load it. See the documentation
for policy manifests for more information.

#### `ERR_MANIFEST_INTEGRITY_MISMATCH`[#](#err_manifest_integrity_mismatch)

Removed in: v22.2.0

An attempt was made to load a policy manifest, but the manifest had multiple
entries for a resource which did not match each other. Update the manifest
entries to match in order to resolve this error. See the documentation for
policy manifests for more information.

#### `ERR_MANIFEST_INVALID_RESOURCE_FIELD`[#](#err_manifest_invalid_resource_field)

Removed in: v22.2.0

A policy manifest resource had an invalid value for one of its fields. Update
the manifest entry to match in order to resolve this error. See the
documentation for policy manifests for more information.

#### `ERR_MANIFEST_INVALID_SPECIFIER`[#](#err_manifest_invalid_specifier)

Removed in: v22.2.0

A policy manifest resource had an invalid value for one of its dependency
mappings. Update the manifest entry to match to resolve this error. See the
documentation for policy manifests for more information.

#### `ERR_MANIFEST_PARSE_POLICY`[#](#err_manifest_parse_policy)

Removed in: v22.2.0

initialization has not yet taken place. This is likely a bug in Node.js.

#### `ERR_MANIFEST_UNKNOWN_ONERROR`[#](#err_manifest_unknown_onerror)

Removed in: v22.2.0

A policy manifest was loaded, but had an unknown value for its "onerror"
behavior. See the documentation for policy manifests for more information.

#### `ERR_MISSING_MESSAGE_PORT_IN_TRANSFER_LIST`[#](#err_missing_message_port_in_transfer_list)

Removed in: v15.0.0

This error code was replaced by [`ERR_MISSING_TRANSFERABLE_IN_TRANSFER_LIST`](#err_missing_transferable_in_transfer_list)
in Node.js 15.0.0, because it is no longer accurate as other types of
transferable objects also exist now.

#### `ERR_MISSING_TRANSFERABLE_IN_TRANSFER_LIST`[#](#err_missing_transferable_in_transfer_list)

Added in: v15.0.0Removed in: v21.0.0History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v21.0.0 | A `DOMException` is thrown instead. |

An object that needs to be explicitly listed in the `transferList` argument
is in the object passed to a [`postMessage()`](worker_threads.html#portpostmessagevalue-transferlist) call, but is not provided
in the `transferList` for that call. Usually, this is a `MessagePort`.

In Node.js versions prior to v15.0.0, the error code being used here was
[`ERR_MISSING_MESSAGE_PORT_IN_TRANSFER_LIST`](#err_missing_message_port_in_transfer_list). However, the set of
transferable object types has been expanded to cover more types than
`MessagePort`.

#### `ERR_NAPI_CONS_PROTOTYPE_OBJECT`[#](#err_napi_cons_prototype_object)

Added in: v9.0.0Removed in: v10.0.0

Added in: v10.6.0, v8.16.0Removed in: v14.2.0, v12.17.0

On the main thread, values are removed from the queue associated with the
thread-safe function in an idle loop. This error indicates that an error
has occurred when attempting to start the loop.

#### `ERR_NAPI_TSFN_STOP_IDLE_LOOP`[#](#err_napi_tsfn_stop_idle_loop)

Added in: v10.6.0, v8.16.0Removed in: v14.2.0, v12.17.0

Once no more items are left in the queue, the idle loop must be suspended. This
error indicates that the idle loop has failed to stop.

#### `ERR_NO_LONGER_SUPPORTED`[#](#err_no_longer_supported)

A Node.js API was called in an unsupported manner, such as
`Buffer.write(string, encoding, offset[, length])`.

#### `ERR_OUTOFMEMORY`[#](#err_outofmemory)

Added in: v9.0.0Removed in: v10.0.0

Data could not be sent on a socket.

#### `ERR_STDERR_CLOSE`[#](#err_stderr_close)

Removed in: v10.12.0History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v10.12.0 | Rather than emitting an error, `process.stderr.end()` now only closes the stream side but not the underlying resource, making this error obsolete. |

An attempt was made to close the `process.stderr` stream. By design, Node.js
does not allow `stdout` or `stderr` streams to be closed by user code.

#### `ERR_STDOUT_CLOSE`[#](#err_stdout_close)

Removed in: v10.12.0History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v10.12.0 | Rather than emitting an error, `process.stderr.end()` now only closes the stream side but not the underlying resource, making this error obsolete. |

An attempt was made to close the `process.stdout` stream. By design, Node.js
does not allow `stdout` or `stderr` streams to be closed by user code.

#### `ERR_STREAM_READ_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`[#](#err_stream_read_not_implemented)

Added in: v9.0.0Removed in: v10.0.0

Used when an attempt is made to use a readable stream that has not implemented
[`readable._read()`](stream.html#readable_readsize).

#### `ERR_TAP_LEXER_ERROR`[#](#err_tap_lexer_error)

An error representing a failing lexer state.

#### `ERR_TAP_PARSER_ERROR`[#](#err_tap_parser_error)

Added in: v10.5.0Removed in: v14.0.0

A `SharedArrayBuffer` whose memory is not managed by the JavaScript engine
or by Node.js was encountered during serialization. Such a `SharedArrayBuffer`
cannot be serialized.

This can only happen when native addons create `SharedArrayBuffer`s in
"externalized" mode, or put existing `SharedArrayBuffer` into externalized mode.

#### `ERR_UNKNOWN_STDIN_TYPE`[#](#err_unknown_stdin_type)

Added in: v8.0.0Removed in: v11.7.0

An attempt was made to launch a Node.js process with an unknown `stdin` file
type. This error is usually an indication of a bug within Node.js itself,
although it is possible for user code to trigger it.

#### `ERR_UNKNOWN_STREAM_TYPE`[#](#err_unknown_stream_type)

Added in: v8.0.0Removed in: v11.7.0

An attempt was made to launch a Node.js process with an unknown `stdout` or

The passed certificate is self-signed and the same certificate cannot be found
in the list of trusted certificates.

##### `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`[#](#self_signed_cert_in_chain)

The certificate’s issuer is not known. This is the case if the issuer is not
included in the trusted certificate list.

value, this is only meaningful for RSA keys.

##### `UNABLE_TO_DECRYPT_CRL_SIGNATURE`[#](#unable_to_decrypt_crl_signature)

The certificate revocation list (CRL) signature could not be decrypted: this
means that the actual signature value could not be determined rather than it not
matching the expected value.
