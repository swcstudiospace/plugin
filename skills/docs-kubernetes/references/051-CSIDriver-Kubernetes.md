# CSIDriver

CSIDriver captures information about a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume driver deployed on the cluster. Kubernetes attach detach controller uses this object to determine whether attach is required. Kubelet uses this object to determine whether pod information needs to be passed on mount. CSIDriver objects are non-namespaced.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` *string* | APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources |
| `kind` *string* | Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds |
| `metadata` *[ObjectMeta](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/definitions/object-meta-v1-meta/#ObjectMeta)* | Standard object metadata. metadata.Name indicates the name of the CSI driver that this object refers to; it MUST be the same name returned by the CSI GetPluginName() call for that driver. The driver name must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata |
| `spec` **\*** *[CSIDriverSpec](#CSIDriverSpec)* | spec represents the specification of the CSI Driver. |

## CSIDriverSpec

CSIDriverSpec is the specification of a CSIDriver.

---

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `attachRequired` *boolean* | attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires an attach operation (because it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume() method), and that the Kubernetes attach detach controller should call the attach volume interface which checks the volumeattachment status and waits until the volume is attached before proceeding to mounting. The CSI external-attacher coordinates with CSI volume driver and updates the volumeattachment status when the attach operation is complete. If the value is specified to false, the attach operation will be skipped. Otherwise the attach operation will be called. This field is immutable. |
| `fsGroupPolicy` *string* | fsGroupPolicy defines if the underlying volume supports changing ownership and permission of the volume before being mounted. Refer to the specific FSGroupPolicy values for additional details. This field was immutable in Kubernetes \< 1.29 and now is mutable. Defaults to ReadWriteOnceWithFSType, which will examine each volume to determine if Kubernetes should modify ownership and permissions of the volume. With the default policy the defined fsGroup will only be applied if a fstype is defined and the volume's access mode contains ReadWriteOnce. |
| `nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds` *integer* | nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds specifies the interval between periodic updates of the CSINode allocatable capacity for this driver. When set, both periodic updates and updates triggered by capacity-related failures are enabled. If not set, no updates occur (neither periodic nor upon detecting capacity-related failures), and the allocatable.count remains static. The minimum allowed value for this field is 10 seconds. This feature requires the MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount feature gate to be enabled. This field is mutable. |
| `podInfoOnMount` *boolean* | podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume driver requires additional pod information (like podName, podUID, etc.) during mount operations, if set to true. If set to false, pod information will not be passed on mount. Default is false. The CSI driver specifies podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If true, Kubelet will pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and validating the information passed in as VolumeContext. The following VolumeContext will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might grow, but the prefix will be used. "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name": pod.Name "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace": pod.Namespace "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid": string(pod.UID) "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral": "true" if the volume is an ephemeral inline volume defined by a CSIVolumeSource, otherwise "false" "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral" is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only required for drivers which support both the "Persistent" and "Ephemeral" VolumeLifecycleMode. Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore this field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't support this field, drivers can only support one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver. This field was immutable in Kubernetes \< 1.29 and now is mutable. |
| `preventPodSchedulingIfMissing` *boolean* | PreventPodSchedulingIfMissing indicates that the CSI driver wants to prevent pod scheduling if the CSI driver on the node is missing. Enabling this option will prevent the scheduler (or any other component which embeds default scheduler such as cluster-autoscaler) from scheduling pods to nodes where CSI driver is not installed. For components(such as cluster-autoscaler) that embed the scheduler and run pod placement simulations using scheduler plugins, they MUST be aware of CSI driver registration information via CSINode object. They must create simulated CSINode objects in addition to Node objects during scheduling simulation, otherwise if PreventPodSchedulingIfMissing is enabled globally for CSIDriver object, any newly created node may be rejected by the scheduler because of missing CSI driver information from the node. This is an alpha feature and requires the VolumeLimitScaling feature gate to be enabled. Default is "false". |
| `requiresRepublish` *boolean* | requiresRepublish indicates the CSI driver wants `NodePublishVolume` being periodically called to reflect any possible change in the mounted volume. This field defaults to false. Note: After a successful initial NodePublishVolume call, subsequent calls to NodePublishVolume should only update the contents of the volume. New mount points will not be seen by a running container. |
| `seLinuxMount` *boolean* | seLinuxMount specifies if the CSI driver supports "-o context" mount option. When "true", the CSI driver must ensure that all volumes provided by this CSI driver can be mounted separately with different `-o context` options. This is typical for storage backends that provide volumes as filesystems on block devices or as independent shared volumes. Kubernetes will call NodeStage / NodePublish with "-o context=xyz" mount option when mounting a ReadWriteOncePod volume used in Pod that has explicitly set SELinux context. In the future, it may be expanded to other volume AccessModes. In any case, Kubernetes will ensure that the volume is mounted only with a single SELinux context. When "false", Kubernetes won't pass any special SELinux mount options to the driver. This is typical for volumes that represent subdirectories of a bigger shared filesystem. Default is "false". |
| `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets` *boolean* | serviceAccountTokenInSecrets is an opt-in for CSI drivers to indicate that service account tokens should be passed via the Secrets field in NodePublishVolumeRequest instead of the VolumeContext field. The CSI specification provides a dedicated Secrets field for sensitive information like tokens, which is the appropriate mechanism for handling credentials. This addresses security concerns where sensitive tokens were being logged as part of volume context. When "true", kubelet will pass the tokens only in the Secrets field with the key "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens". The CSI driver must be updated to read tokens from the Secrets field instead of VolumeContext. When "false" or not set, kubelet will pass the tokens in VolumeContext with the key "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens" (existing behavior). This maintains backward compatibility with existing CSI drivers. This field can only be set when TokenRequests is configured. The API server will reject CSIDriver specs that set this field without TokenRequests. Default behavior if unset is to pass tokens in the VolumeContext field. |
| `storageCapacity` *boolean* | storageCapacity indicates that the CSI volume driver wants pod scheduling to consider the storage capacity that the driver deployment will report by creating CSIStorageCapacity objects with capacity information, if set to true. The check can be enabled immediately when deploying a driver. In that case, provisioning new volumes with late binding will pause until the driver deployment has published some suitable CSIStorageCapacity object. Alternatively, the driver can be deployed with the field unset or false and it can be flipped later when storage capacity information has been published. This field was immutable in Kubernetes \<= 1.22 and now is mutable. |
| `tokenRequests` *[TokenRequest array](#TokenRequest)* | tokenRequests indicates the CSI driver needs pods' service account tokens it is mounting volume for to do necessary authentication. Kubelet will pass the tokens in VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume calls. The CSI driver should parse and validate the following VolumeContext: "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens": { "\": { "token": \, "expirationTimestamp": \, }, ... } Note: Audience in each TokenRequest should be different and at most one token is empty string. To receive a new token after expiry, RequiresRepublish can be used to trigger NodePublishVolume periodically. |
| `volumeLifecycleModes` *string array* | volumeLifecycleModes defines what kind of volumes this CSI volume driver supports. The default if the list is empty is "Persistent", which is the usage defined by the CSI specification and implemented in Kubernetes via the usual PV/PVC mechanism. The other mode is "Ephemeral". In this mode, volumes are defined inline inside the pod spec with CSIVolumeSource and their lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of that pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it is only going to get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume. For more information about implementing this mode, see https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html A driver can support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the future. This field is beta. This field is immutable. |

### `delete` Delete

#### HTTP Request

DELETE /apis/storage.k8s.io/v1/csidrivers/{name}

#### Path Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | *string* | name of the CSIDriver |

#### Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pretty` | *string* | If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget). |
| `dryRun` | *string* | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `gracePeriodSeconds` | *integer* | The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately. |
| `ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential` | *boolean* | if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it |
| `orphanDependents` | *boolean* | Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both. |
| `propagationPolicy` | *string* | Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground. |

#### Body Parameters

### `delete` Delete Collection

#### HTTP Request

DELETE /apis/storage.k8s.io/v1/csidrivers

#### Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pretty` | *string* | If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget). |
| `continue` | *string* | The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications. |
| `dryRun` | *string* | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `fieldSelector` | *string* | A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything. |
| `gracePeriodSeconds` | *integer* | The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately. |
| `ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential` | *boolean* | if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it |
| `labelSelector` | *string* | A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything. |
| `limit` | *integer* | limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned. |
| `orphanDependents` | *boolean* | Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both. |
| `propagationPolicy` | *string* | Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground. |
| `resourceVersion` | *string* | resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details. Defaults to unset |
| `resourceVersionMatch` | *string* | resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details. Defaults to unset |
| `sendInitialEvents` | *boolean* | `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched. When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`" and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions. If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset Invalid error is returned. Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise. |
| `shardSelector` | *string* | shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with || (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') || shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths: - object.metadata.uid - object.metadata.namespace hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64. Examples: 2-shard split: shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000') shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') 4-shard split: shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000') shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000') shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000') shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') This is an alpha field and requires enabling the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | *integer* | Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity. |

### `get` List

#### HTTP Request

GET /apis/storage.k8s.io/v1/csidrivers

#### Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pretty` | *string* | If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget). |
| `allowWatchBookmarks` | *boolean* | allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. |
| `continue` | *string* | The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications. |
| `fieldSelector` | *string* | A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything. |
| `labelSelector` | *string* | A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything. |
| `limit` | *integer* | limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned. |
| `resourceVersion` | *string* | resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details. Defaults to unset |
| `resourceVersionMatch` | *string* | resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details. Defaults to unset |
| `sendInitialEvents` | *boolean* | `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched. When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`" and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions. If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset Invalid error is returned. Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise. |
| `shardSelector` | *string* | shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with || (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') || shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths: - object.metadata.uid - object.metadata.namespace hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64. Examples: 2-shard split: shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000') shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') 4-shard split: shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000') shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000') shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000') shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') This is an alpha field and requires enabling the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | *integer* | Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity. |
| `watch` | *boolean* | Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion. |
