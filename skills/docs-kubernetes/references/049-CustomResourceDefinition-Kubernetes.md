| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` *string* | APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources |
| `kind` *string* | Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds |
| `metadata` *[ObjectMeta](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/definitions/object-meta-v1-meta/#ObjectMeta)* | Standard object's metadata More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata |

| `group` **\*** *string* | group is the API group of the defined custom resource. The custom resources are served under `/apis/\/...`. Must match the name of the CustomResourceDefinition (in the form `\.\`). |
| `names` **\*** *[CustomResourceDefinitionNames](#CustomResourceDefinitionNames)* | names specify the resource and kind names for the custom resource. |
| `preserveUnknownFields` *boolean* | preserveUnknownFields indicates that object fields which are not specified in the OpenAPI schema should be preserved when persisting to storage. apiVersion, kind, metadata and known fields inside metadata are always preserved. This field is deprecated in favor of setting `x-preserve-unknown-fields` to true in `spec.versions[\*].schema.openAPIV3Schema`. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#field-pruning for details. |
| `scope` **\*** *string* | scope indicates whether the defined custom resource is cluster- or namespace-scoped. Allowed values are `Cluster` and `Namespaced`. |
| `versions` **\*** *[CustomResourceDefinitionVersion array](#CustomResourceDefinitionVersion)* | versions is the list of all API versions of the defined custom resource. Version names are used to compute the order in which served versions are listed in API discovery. If the version string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10. |

This extension may be used on any type of list (struct, scalar, ...). 2) `set`: Sets are lists that must not have multiple items with the same value. Each value must be a scalar, an object with x-kubernetes-map-type `atomic` or an array with x-kubernetes-list-type `atomic`. 3) `map`: These lists are like maps in that their elements have a non-index key used to identify them. Order is preserved upon merge. The map tag must only be used on a list with elements of type object. Defaults to atomic for arrays. |
| `x-kubernetes-map-type` *string* | x-kubernetes-map-type annotates an object to further describe its topology. This extension must only be used when type is object and may have 2 possible values: 1) `granular`: These maps are actual maps (key-value pairs) and each fields are independent from each other (they can each be manipulated by separate actors). This is the default behaviour for all maps. 2) `atomic`: the list is treated as a single entity, like a scalar. Atomic maps will be entirely replaced when updated. |
| `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields` *boolean* | x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields stops the API server decoding step from pruning fields which are not specified in the validation schema. This affects fields recursively, but switches back to normal pruning behaviour if nested properties or additionalProperties are specified in the schema. This can either be true or undefined. False is forbidden. |
| `x-kubernetes-validations` *[ValidationRule array](#ValidationRule)* *patch strategy: merge on key `rule`* | x-kubernetes-validations describes a list of validation rules written in the CEL expression language. |

## JSONSchemaPropsOrArray

JSONSchemaPropsOrArray represents a value that can either be a JSONSchemaProps or an array of JSONSchemaProps. Mainly here for serialization purposes.

---

## JSONSchemaPropsOrBool

JSONSchemaPropsOrBool represents JSONSchemaProps or a boolean value. Defaults to true for the boolean property.

---

## SelectableField

SelectableField specifies the JSON path of a field that may be used with field selectors.

---

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `jsonPath` **\*** *string* | jsonPath is a simple JSON path which is evaluated against each custom resource to produce a field selector value. Only JSON paths without the array notation are allowed. Must point to a field of type string, boolean or integer. Types with enum values and strings with formats are allowed. If jsonPath refers to absent field in a resource, the jsonPath evaluates to an empty string. Must not point to metdata fields. Required. |

## ServiceReference

ServiceReference holds a reference to Service.legacy.k8s.io

---

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` **\*** *string* | name is the name of the service. Required |
| `namespace` **\*** *string* | namespace is the namespace of the service. Required |
| `path` *string* | path is an optional URL path at which the webhook will be contacted. |
| `port` *integer* | port is an optional service port at which the webhook will be contacted. `port` should be a valid port number (1-65535, inclusive). Defaults to 443 for backward compatibility. |

## ValidationRule

ValidationRule describes a validation rule written in the CEL expression language.

---

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `fieldPath` *string* | fieldPath represents the field path returned when the validation fails. It must be a relative JSON path (i.e. with array notation) scoped to the location of this x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema and refer to an existing field. e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testMap.foo` If the validation checks two lists must have unique attributes, the fieldPath could be set to either of the list: e.g. `.testList` It does not support list numeric index. It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info. Numeric index of array is not supported. For field name which contains special characters, use `['specialName']` to refer the field name. e.g. for attribute `foo.34$` appears in a list `testList`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testList['foo.34$']` |
| `message` *string* | Message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Rule contains line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks. If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}". e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host" |
| `messageExpression` *string* | MessageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails. Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string. If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the runtime error is logged, and the validation failure message is produced as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset, and the fact that messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged. messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type. Example: "x must be less than max ("+string(self.max)+")" |
| `optionalOldSelf` *boolean* | optionalOldSelf is used to opt a transition rule into evaluation even when the object is first created, or if the old object is missing the value. When enabled `oldSelf` will be a CEL optional whose value will be `None` if there is no old value, or when the object is initially created. You may check for presence of oldSelf using `oldSelf.hasValue()` and unwrap it after checking using `oldSelf.value()`. Check the CEL documentation for Optional types for more information: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/cel#OptionalTypes May not be set unless `oldSelf` is used in `rule`. |
| `reason` *string* | reason provides a machine-readable validation failure reason that is returned to the caller when a request fails this validation rule. The HTTP status code returned to the caller will match the reason of the reason of the first failed validation rule. The currently supported reasons are: "FieldValueInvalid", "FieldValueForbidden", "FieldValueRequired", "FieldValueDuplicate". If not set, default to use "FieldValueInvalid". All future added reasons must be accepted by clients when reading this value and unknown reasons should be treated as FieldValueInvalid.  Possible enum values: - `"FieldValueDuplicate"` is used to report collisions of values that must be unique (e.g. unique IDs). - `"FieldValueForbidden"` is used to report valid (as per formatting rules) values which would be accepted under some conditions, but which are not permitted by the current conditions (such as security policy). - `"FieldValueInvalid"` is used to report malformed values (e.g. failed regex match, too long, out of bounds). - `"FieldValueRequired"` is used to report required values that are not provided (e.g. empty strings, null values, or empty arrays). |
| `rule` **\*** *string* | Rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec The Rule is scoped to the location of the x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema. The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {"rule": "self.status.actual \<= self.spec.maxDesired"} If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {"rule": "self.components['Widget'].priority \< 10"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {"rule": "self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value \< 100)"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {"rule": "self.startsWith('kube')"} The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible. Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an "unknown type". An "unknown type" is recursively defined as: - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true - An array where the items schema is of an "unknown type" - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an "unknown type" Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z\_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9\_.-/]\*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '\_\_' escapes to '\_\_underscores\_\_' - '.' escapes to '\_\_dot\_\_' - '-' escapes to '\_\_dash\_\_' - '/' escapes to '\_\_slash\_\_' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '\_\_{keyword}\_\_'. The keywords are: "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if", "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return". Examples: - Rule accessing a property named "namespace": {"rule": "self.\_\_namespace\_\_ > 0"} - Rule accessing a property named "x-prop": {"rule": "self.x\_\_dash\_\_prop > 0"} - Rule accessing a property named "redact\_\_d": {"rule": "self.redact\_\_underscores\_\_d > 0"} Equality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type: - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order. - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order. If `rule` makes use of the `oldSelf` variable it is implicitly a `transition rule`. By default, the `oldSelf` variable is the same type as `self`. When `optionalOldSelf` is true, the `oldSelf` variable is a CEL optional variable whose value() is the same type as `self`. See the documentation for the `optionalOldSelf` field for details. Transition rules by default are applied only on UPDATE requests and are skipped if an old value could not be found. You can opt a transition rule into unconditional evaluation by setting `optionalOldSelf` to true. |

## WebhookClientConfig

WebhookClientConfig contains the information to make a TLS connection with the webhook.

---

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `caBundle` *string* | caBundle is a PEM encoded CA bundle which will be used to validate the webhook's server certificate. If unspecified, system trust roots on the apiserver are used. |
| `service` *[ServiceReference](#ServiceReference)* | service is a reference to the service for this webhook. Either service or url must be specified. If the webhook is running within the cluster, then you should use `service`. |
| `url` *string* | url gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service` must be specified. The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may also be an IP address. Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy to turn up in a new cluster. The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://". A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook, for example, a cluster identifier. Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not allowed, either. |

## WebhookConversion

WebhookConversion describes how to call a conversion webhook

---

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `clientConfig` *[WebhookClientConfig](#WebhookClientConfig)* | clientConfig is the instructions for how to call the webhook if strategy is `Webhook`. |
| `conversionReviewVersions` **\*** *string array* | conversionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred `ConversionReview` versions the Webhook expects. The API server will use the first version in the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this list are supported by API server, conversion will fail for the custom resource. If a persisted Webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not include any versions known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail. |

### `delete` Delete

#### HTTP Request

DELETE /apis/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1/customresourcedefinitions/{name}

#### Path Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | *string* | name of the CustomResourceDefinition |

#### Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pretty` | *string* | If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget). |
| `dryRun` | *string* | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `gracePeriodSeconds` | *integer* | The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately. |
| `ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential` | *boolean* | if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it |
| `orphanDependents` | *boolean* | Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both. |
| `propagationPolicy` | *string* | Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground. |

#### Body Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `body` | *[DeleteOptions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/definitions/delete-options-v1-meta/#DeleteOptions)* |  |

### `delete` Delete Collection

#### HTTP Request

DELETE /apis/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1/customresourcedefinitions

#### Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pretty` | *string* | If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget). |
| `continue` | *string* | The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications. |
| `dryRun` | *string* | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `fieldSelector` | *string* | A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything. |
| `gracePeriodSeconds` | *integer* | The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately. |
| `ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential` | *boolean* | if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it |
| `labelSelector` | *string* | A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything. |
| `limit` | *integer* | limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned. |
| `orphanDependents` | *boolean* | Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both. |
| `propagationPolicy` | *string* | Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground. |
| `resourceVersion` | *string* | resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details. Defaults to unset |
| `resourceVersionMatch` | *string* | resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details. Defaults to unset |
| `sendInitialEvents` | *boolean* | `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched. When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`" and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions. If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset Invalid error is returned. Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise. |
| `shardSelector` | *string* | shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with || (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') || shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths: - object.metadata.uid - object.metadata.namespace hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64. Examples: 2-shard split: shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000') shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') 4-shard split: shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000') shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000') shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000') shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') This is an alpha field and requires enabling the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | *integer* | Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity. |

#### Body Parameters

| `pretty` | *string* | If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget). |
| `allowWatchBookmarks` | *boolean* | allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. |
| `continue` | *string* | The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token.

Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched. When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`" and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions. If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset Invalid error is returned. Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise. |
| `shardSelector` | *string* | shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with || (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') || shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths: - object.metadata.uid - object.metadata.namespace hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64. Examples: 2-shard split: shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000') shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') 4-shard split: shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000') shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000') shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000') shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000') This is an alpha field and requires enabling the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | *integer* | Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity. |
| `watch` | *boolean* | Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion. |

### `get` Watch

#### HTTP Request

GET /apis/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1/watch/customresourcedefinitions/{name}

#### Path Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | *string* | name of the CustomResourceDefinition |

#### Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowWatchBookmarks` | *boolean* | allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. |
| `continue` | *string* | The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications. |
| `fieldSelector` | *string* | A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything. |
| `labelSelector` | *string* | A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything. |
| `limit` | *integer* | limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned. |
| `pretty` | *string* | If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget). |
| `resourceVersion` | *string* | resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details. Defaults to unset |
| `resourceVersionMatch` | *string* | resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details. Defaults to unset |
| `sendInitialEvents` | *boolean* | `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event will be sent.

| `pretty` | *string* | If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget). |
| `dryRun` | *string* | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `fieldManager` | *string* | fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint. This field is required for apply requests (application/apply-patch) but optional for non-apply patch types (JsonPatch, MergePatch, StrategicMergePatch). |
| `fieldValidation` | *string* | fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |
| `force` | *boolean* | Force is going to "force" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests. |
