# Documentation Content Guide

This page contains guidelines for Kubernetes documentation.

If you have questions about what's allowed, join the #sig-docs channel in
[Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) and ask!

You can register for Kubernetes Slack at <https://slack.k8s.io/>.

For information on creating new content for the Kubernetes
docs, follow the [style guide](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/).

## Overview

Source for the Kubernetes website, including the docs, resides in the
[kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) repository.

Located in the `kubernetes/website/content/<language_code>/docs` folder, the
majority of Kubernetes documentation is specific to the [Kubernetes
project](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes).

## What's allowed

Kubernetes docs allow content for third-party projects only when:

- Content documents software in the Kubernetes project
- Content documents software that's out of project but necessary for Kubernetes to function
- Content is canonical on kubernetes.io, or links to canonical content elsewhere

### Third party content

Kubernetes documentation includes applied examples of projects in the Kubernetes
project—projects that live in the [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes) and
[kubernetes-sigs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs) GitHub organizations.

Links to active content in the Kubernetes project are always allowed.

Kubernetes requires some third party content to function. Examples include container runtimes (containerd, CRI-O, Docker),
[networking policy](/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) (CNI plugins),
[Ingress controllers](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/),
and [logging](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/).

Docs can link to third-party open source software (OSS) outside the Kubernetes
project only if it's necessary for Kubernetes to function.

### Dual sourced content

Wherever possible, Kubernetes docs link to canonical sources instead of hosting
dual-sourced content.

Dual-sourced content requires double the effort (or more!) to maintain
and grows stale more quickly.

#### Note:

If you're a maintainer for a Kubernetes project and need help hosting your own docs,
ask for help in [#sig-docs on Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C1J0BPD2M/).

### More information

If you have questions about allowed content, join the [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) #sig-docs channel and ask!
