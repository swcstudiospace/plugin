# Limit Ranges

By default, containers run with unbounded
[compute resources](/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) on a Kubernetes cluster.
Using Kubernetes [resource quotas](/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/),
administrators (also termed *cluster operators*) can restrict consumption and creation
of cluster resources (such as CPU time, memory, and persistent storage) within a specified
[namespace](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces "An abstraction used by Kubernetes to support isolation of groups of resources within a single cluster.").
Within a namespace, a [Pod](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ "A Pod represents a set of running containers in your cluster.") can consume as much CPU and memory as is allowed by the ResourceQuotas that apply to that namespace.
As a cluster operator, or as a namespace-level administrator, you might also be concerned
about making sure that a single object cannot monopolize all available resources within a namespace.

A LimitRange is a policy to constrain the resource allocations (limits and requests) that you can specify for
each applicable object kind (such as Pod or [PersistentVolumeClaim](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims "Claims storage resources defined in a PersistentVolume so that it can be mounted as a volume in a container.")) in a namespace.

A *LimitRange* provides constraints that can:

- Enforce minimum and maximum compute resources usage per Pod or Container in a namespace.
- Enforce minimum and maximum storage request per
  [PersistentVolumeClaim](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims "Claims storage resources defined in a PersistentVolume so that it can be mounted as a volume in a container.") in a namespace.
- Enforce a ratio between request and limit for a resource in a namespace.
- Set default request/limit for compute resources in a namespace and automatically
  inject them to Containers at runtime.

Kubernetes constrains resource allocations to Pods in a particular namespace
whenever there is at least one LimitRange object in that namespace.

The name of a LimitRange object must be a valid
[DNS subdomain name](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names).

## Constraints on resource limits and requests

- The administrator creates a LimitRange in a namespace.
- Users create (or try to create) objects in that namespace, such as Pods or
  PersistentVolumeClaims.
- First, the LimitRange admission controller applies default request and limit values
  for all Pods (and their containers) that do not set compute resource requirements.
- Second, the LimitRange tracks usage to ensure it does not exceed resource minimum,
  maximum and ratio defined in any LimitRange present in the namespace.
- If you attempt to create or update an object (Pod or PersistentVolumeClaim) that violates
  a LimitRange constraint, your request to the API server will fail with an HTTP status
  code `403 Forbidden` and a message explaining the constraint that has been violated.
- If you add a LimitRange in a namespace that applies to compute-related resources
  such as `cpu` and `memory`, you must specify requests or limits for those values.
  Otherwise, the system may reject Pod creation.
- LimitRange validations occur only at Pod admission stage, not on running Pods.
  If you add or modify a LimitRange, the Pods that already exist in that namespace
  continue unchanged.
- If two or more LimitRange objects exist in the namespace, it is not deterministic
  which default value will be applied.

## LimitRange and admission checks for Pods

A LimitRange does **not** check the consistency of the default values it applies.
This means that a default value for the *limit* that is set by LimitRange may be
less than the *request* value specified for the container in the spec that a client
submits to the API server. If that happens, the final Pod will not be schedulable.

For example, you define a LimitRange with below manifest:

#### Note:

The following examples operate within the default namespace of your cluster, as the namespace
parameter is undefined and the LimitRange scope is limited to the namespace level.
This implies that any references or operations within these examples will interact
with elements within the default namespace of your cluster. You can override the
operating namespace by configuring namespace in the `metadata.namespace` field.

[`concepts/policy/limit-range/problematic-limit-range.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/concepts/policy/limit-range/problematic-limit-range.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy concepts/policy/limit-range/problematic-limit-range.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: cpu-resource-constraint
spec:
  limits:
  - default: # this section defines default limits
      cpu: 500m
    defaultRequest: # this section defines default requests
      cpu: 500m
    max: # max and min define the limit range
      cpu: "1"
    min:
      cpu: 100m
    type: Container
```

along with a Pod that declares a CPU resource request of `700m`, but not a limit:

[`concepts/policy/limit-range/example-conflict-with-limitrange-cpu.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/concepts/policy/limit-range/example-conflict-with-limitrange-cpu.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy concepts/policy/limit-range/example-conflict-with-limitrange-cpu.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-conflict-with-limitrange-cpu
spec:
  containers:
  - name: demo
    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.8
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 700m
```

then that Pod will not be scheduled, failing with an error similar to:

```
Pod "example-conflict-with-limitrange-cpu" is invalid: spec.containers[0].resources.requests: Invalid value: "700m": must be less than or equal to cpu limit
```

If you set both `request` and `limit`, then that new Pod will be scheduled successfully
even with the same LimitRange in place:

[`concepts/policy/limit-range/example-no-conflict-with-limitrange-cpu.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/concepts/policy/limit-range/example-no-conflict-with-limitrange-cpu.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy concepts/policy/limit-range/example-no-conflict-with-limitrange-cpu.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-no-conflict-with-limitrange-cpu
spec:
  containers:
  - name: demo
    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.8
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 700m
      limits:
        cpu: 700m
```

## Example resource constraints

Examples of policies that could be created using LimitRange are:

- In a 2 node cluster with a capacity of 8 GiB RAM and 16 cores, constrain Pods in a
  namespace to request 100m of CPU with a max limit of 500m for CPU and request 200Mi
  for Memory with a max limit of 600Mi for Memory.
- Define default CPU limit and request to 150m and memory default request to 300Mi for
  Containers started with no cpu and memory requests in their specs.

In the case where the total limits of the namespace is less than the sum of the limits
of the Pods/Containers, there may be contention for resources. In this case, the
Containers or Pods will not be created.

Neither contention nor changes to a LimitRange will affect already created resources.
