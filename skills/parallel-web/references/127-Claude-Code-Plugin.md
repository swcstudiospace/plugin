# Claude Code Plugin
> Add Parallel web search, extraction, deep research, and data enrichment to Claude Code

For AI agents: a documentation index is available at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt). The full text of all docs is at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt).

The Parallel plugin for Claude Code gives your coding agent access to live web search, content extraction, deep research, and data enrichment — all available as slash commands and automatic skills directly inside Claude Code.

## Features
\* \*\*Web Search\*\*: Fast, real-time search for current events, documentation lookups, and fact-checking
\* \*\*Content Extraction\*\*: Clean content extraction from any URL, including JavaScript-heavy sites and PDFs
\* \*\*Deep Research\*\*: Exhaustive, multi-source research reports with configurable depth and processing power
\* \*\*Data Enrichment\*\*: Bulk enrichment of companies, people, or products with web-sourced fields like CEO names, funding, and contact info
## Prerequisites

Install the [Parallel CLI](/integrations/cli) via `pipx`:
```bash theme={"system"}
pipx install "parallel-web-tools[cli]" && pipx ensurepath
```
See the [CLI docs](/integrations/cli) for `uv`, Homebrew, npm, and other installation methods.

```bash theme={"system"}
parallel-cli login
# or
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="your\_api\_key"
```
See the [CLI docs](/integrations/cli#authentication) for other authentication methods.
## Installation
Install the plugin from the Claude Code Plugin Marketplace:
```bash theme={"system"}
/plugin marketplace add parallel-web/parallel-agent-skills
/plugin install parallel
```
Then run the setup command to verify the CLI is installed and authenticated:
```
/parallel:setup
```
## Slash Commands
Once installed, the following commands are available in Claude Code:
| Command | Description |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/parallel:search ` | Search the web for current information |
| `/parallel:extract ` | Extract content from a URL |
| `/parallel:research ` | Run a deep research task |
| `/parallel:enrich ` | Enrich a list of entities with web data |
| `/parallel:status ` | Check the status of a research task |
| `/parallel:result ` | Get the results of a completed research task |
| `/parallel:setup` | Install CLI and authenticate |
## Usage
Beyond slash commands, the plugin also installs skills that Claude Code uses automatically based on context:
\* Ask a question that needs current information and Claude will search the web
\* Paste a URL and ask Claude to read it — it will extract the content
\* Ask for exhaustive research on a topic and Claude will run a deep research task
\* Give Claude a list of companies and ask it to find their CEOs — it will use data enrichment
