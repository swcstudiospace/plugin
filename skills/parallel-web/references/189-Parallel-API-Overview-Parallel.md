# Parallel Search API — Setup Prompt

You're integrating the **Parallel Search API**: a natural-language web search that returns LLM-optimized excerpts.

## When to use it

Use Search when the model needs current facts, specific entities, or web data to ground a response. One round-trip: natural-language objective + 2-3 keyword queries → LLM-optimized excerpts (pre-compressed, citation-aware) ready to feed into model context. Faster than multi-hop research; better than raw keyword search because the excerpts arrive shaped for the model.

## Setup

```bash
pip install "parallel-web>=1.0.1"    # Python SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `from parallel import Parallel`
npm install "parallel-web@^1.0.1"    # TypeScript SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `import Parallel from "parallel-web"`

# Treat PARALLEL_API_KEY like a password — load from .env or a secrets manager, don't commit it.
export PARALLEL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Example (Python — adapt to my codebase's language)

```python
from parallel import Parallel

client = Parallel()  # reads PARALLEL_API_KEY from env

# Both objective and search_queries are required — they play distinct roles:
# objective = natural-language research goal (task context, full sentences OK);
# search_queries = 2-3 diverse 3-6-word keyword queries (vary entities/angles, no sentences).
# Mode and other tuning (max_results, max_chars_total) are handler-side levers —
# keep them OUT of the tool schema your agent sees (exposing them often hurts quality).
# Mode defaults to "advanced" (slower, highest-quality — background agents, complex queries).
# Pass mode="turbo" in your handler for the lowest latency (p50 ~200ms) in real-time,
# high-volume workloads, or mode="basic" for quick retrieval with deeper context per call.
# See https://docs.parallel.ai/search/modes and https://docs.parallel.ai/integrations/tool-definition.
search = client.search(
    objective="Find recent benchmarks and cost comparisons between major vector databases (pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant).",
    search_queries=[
        "pgvector Pinecone benchmark 2025",
        "vector database cost comparison",
        "Weaviate Qdrant performance review",
    ],
)

for result in search.results:
    print(f"{result.title}: {result.url}")
    for excerpt in result.excerpts:
        print(excerpt[:200])
```

## Tool definition (for agent function-calling)

Register this in your agent's tool list (OpenAI function-calling format):

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "search_web",
    "description": "Searches the live web using a natural-language objective plus keyword queries, returning LLM-optimized excerpts (pre-compressed, citation-aware) ready to feed into model context. Use whenever the model needs current facts, specific named entities, recent events, or information that likely isn't in training data. Prefer over repeated keyword searches — one call covers the ground of 2-3 traditional queries with better relevance.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "objective": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "A concise, self-contained search query. Must include the key entity or topic being searched for."
        },
        "search_queries": {
          "type": "array",
          "description": "2-3 diverse keyword search queries, each 3-6 words. Must be diverse — vary entity names, synonyms, and angles. Each query must include the key entity or topic. NEVER write sentences, instructions, or use site: operators.",
          "items": { "type": "string" },
          "minItems": 2,
          "maxItems": 3
        }
      },
      "required": ["objective", "search_queries"]
    }
  }
}
```

## TypeScript notes

- Import: `import Parallel from "parallel-web"` (default export, not `import { Parallel }`).
- Request/response fields stay snake_case: `search_queries`, `search.results[].url`. Don't camelCase them — your linter may try.
- Wrap the call in an `async` function and `await` it.
- Need Anthropic-format tools instead of OpenAI? Drop the `"type": "function"` envelope, rename `parameters` → `input_schema`, and lift `name` / `description` to the top level.

# Parallel Extract API — Setup Prompt

You're integrating the **Parallel Extract API**: converts any public URL into clean, LLM-optimized markdown.

## When to use it

Use Extract when you already know which URL(s) to read — typically after Search has narrowed the list, or when the user hands the agent a URL directly. Handles JavaScript-rendered pages and PDFs, not just static HTML. Pass a `target_content` objective to get focused excerpts; omit it for a full-page markdown dump. Up to 20 URLs per call.

## Setup

```bash
pip install "parallel-web>=1.0.1"    # Python SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `from parallel import Parallel`
npm install "parallel-web@^1.0.1"    # TypeScript SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `import Parallel from "parallel-web"`

# Treat PARALLEL_API_KEY like a password — load from .env or a secrets manager, don't commit it.
export PARALLEL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Example (Python — adapt to my codebase's language)

```python
from parallel import Parallel

client = Parallel()  # reads PARALLEL_API_KEY from env

# Provide an objective to focus extraction on relevant content.
# Up to 20 URLs per request. Pages that fail to fetch appear in extract.errors.
extract = client.extract(
    urls=["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762"],
    objective="Explain the multi-head self-attention mechanism and why it replaces recurrence.",
)

for result in extract.results:
    print(f"{result.title}: {result.url}")
    for excerpt in result.excerpts:
        print(excerpt[:200])

# Don't silently drop failed URLs — inspect extract.errors[].url / .error_type.
for err in extract.errors:
    print(f"FAILED {err.url}: {err.error_type}")
```

## Tool definition (for agent function-calling)

Register this in your agent's tool list (OpenAI function-calling format). In your tool handler, map `target_content` → the Extract API `objective` field when the model provides it.

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "web_fetch",
    "description": "Fetches one or more URLs and returns clean LLM-optimized markdown — handles JavaScript-rendered pages and PDFs, not just static HTML. When target_content is provided, narrows the response to excerpts most relevant to that target; otherwise returns the full page. Use after search_web to pull the contents of a specific page the model decided it needs to read in depth, or when the user hands the agent a URL directly.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "urls": {
          "type": "array",
          "description": "The URLs to fetch content from.",
          "items": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "target_content": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The content to target from the page. For example, information about a certain method or a class in a page. If not provided, the entire page is fetched."
        }
      },
      "required": ["urls"]
    }
  }
}
```

## TypeScript notes

- Import: `import Parallel from "parallel-web"` (default export, not `import { Parallel }`).
- Method: `await client.extract({ urls, objective })` — top-level on the client, not `client.extractions.*`.
- Response fields stay snake_case: `result.publish_date`, `result.full_content`, `err.error_type`, `err.http_status_code`. Don't camelCase them.
- Wrap the call in an `async` function and `await` it.
- PDF handling is server-side — no TS-side parsing needed for the arxiv example above.

# Parallel Task API (Deep Research) — Setup Prompt

You're integrating the **Parallel Task API** for deep research: a single API call that takes a plain-language input and returns comprehensive, cited results.

## When to use it

Use the Task API for multi-hop research that needs minutes (not seconds) and citations — questions a single Search call can't answer because they require synthesis across many sources. Plain-language input, structured cited output in `result.output.basis`. For `pro` (~10 min), blocking is fine; for `ultra`/`ultra8x` (up to 2hr), use webhooks. If you only need one search pass, use Search instead.

## Setup

```bash
pip install "parallel-web>=1.0.1"    # Python SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `from parallel import Parallel`
npm install "parallel-web@^1.0.1"    # TypeScript SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `import Parallel from "parallel-web"`

# Treat PARALLEL_API_KEY like a password — load from .env or a secrets manager, don't commit it.
export PARALLEL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Example (Python — adapt to my codebase's language)

```python
from parallel import Parallel

client = Parallel()  # reads PARALLEL_API_KEY from env

# For deep research, use the "pro" or "ultra" processors.
# Append "-fast" for lower latency (e.g. "pro-fast", "ultra-fast").
# For "ultra" / "ultra8x" (up to ~2hr), don't block — use webhooks instead.
# See https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/webhooks. Blocking is only a good pattern for "pro" (<10 min).
task_run = client.task_run.create(
    input="Research the latest developments in AI search technology",
    processor="pro",
)

# Block until the task completes (appropriate for "pro"; avoid for ultra-tier).
result = client.task_run.result(task_run.run_id, api_timeout=3600)

# result.output.content is the research answer.
# result.output.basis is a list of per-field citations + reasoning.
print(result.output.content)
for field in result.output.basis:
    print(f"- {field.field}: {len(field.citations)} citations")
```

## TypeScript notes

- Import: `import Parallel from "parallel-web"` (default export).
- Methods are camelCase (`client.taskRun.create`), but body/response fields stay snake_case (`task_run.run_id`, `result.output.basis`). Mixed casing is load-bearing — don't let your linter normalize it.
- **For `pro` runs (<10 min, blocking is fine):** Python's `api_timeout=3600` has no TS equivalent. Use `{ timeout: 25 }` (per-request seconds) inside a poll loop, retrying ~144 times for a 1-hour budget. `catch` generic errors and rethrow on the last iteration. See the TypeScript tab at [/task-api/examples/task-deep-research](https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/examples/task-deep-research).
- Strict-flow note: `let runResult` isn't proven defined after the poll loop, so reference it as `runResult!` (or guard with `if (!runResult) throw ...`) when accessing `.output.content` / `.output.basis`.
- **For `ultra` / `ultra8x` runs (up to 2hr), don't poll — use webhooks.** Blocking an HTTP connection for hours is not the design. Register a webhook at create time: `client.taskRun.create({ webhook: { url, event_types: ["task_run.status"] } })`. See [/task-api/webhooks](https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/webhooks).

# Parallel Task API (Enrichment) — Setup Prompt

You're integrating the **Parallel Task API** for data enrichment: populate structured fields about an entity (company, person, product) from live web data.

## When to use it

Use the Task API with a JSON output schema when you already have a list of entities and need to populate structured fields about each — founding date, funding, employee count, whatever. Per-field citations come back in `result.output.basis` for audit trails. For many records in one go, use the Group API. If you don't have the list yet, use FindAll to discover first.

## Setup

```bash
pip install "parallel-web>=1.0.1"    # Python SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `from parallel import Parallel`
npm install "parallel-web@^1.0.1"    # TypeScript SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `import Parallel from "parallel-web"`

# Treat PARALLEL_API_KEY like a password — load from .env or a secrets manager, don't commit it.
export PARALLEL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Example (Python — adapt to my codebase's language)

```python
from parallel import Parallel

client = Parallel()  # reads PARALLEL_API_KEY from env

# Enrich a record with structured web data.
# Processors: lite (~2 fields), base (~5 fields), core (~10 fields), core2x (~10 fields, complex),
#   pro (~20 fields, exploratory), ultra/ultra2x/ultra4x/ultra8x (~20-25 fields, deep research).
# Append "-fast" for lower latency (e.g. "core-fast"). See https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/guides/choose-a-processor.
# Tip: structured input (dict) grounds the run better than a bare string.
task_run = client.task_run.create(
    input={"company": "Stripe", "website": "stripe.com"},
    task_spec={
        "output_schema": {
            "type": "json",
            "json_schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "founding_date": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "Founding date in MM-YYYY format"
                    },
                    "employee_count": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "Estimated number of employees"
                    },
                    "funding_sources": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "Description of funding sources and amounts"
                    }
                },
                "required": ["founding_date", "employee_count", "funding_sources"],
                "additionalProperties": False
            }
        }
    },
    processor="base",  # ~5 fields. Use "core" for ~10, "pro" for ~20+.
)

# Block until the enrichment completes. For many records, use the Group API: https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/group-api
result = client.task_run.result(task_run.run_id, api_timeout=3600)

# result.output.content is the populated JSON dict.
# result.output.basis carries per-field citations + reasoning (auditable provenance).
print(result.output.content)
for field in result.output.basis:
    print(f"- {field.field}: {len(field.citations)} citations")
```

## TypeScript notes

- Import: `import Parallel from "parallel-web"` (default export).
- Methods camelCase (`client.taskRun.create`), body fields snake_case (`task_spec`, `output_schema`, `json_schema`, `additional_properties` stays as JSON-Schema `additionalProperties: false`). Your linter may try to camelCase body fields — the call will fail if it does.
- **Python's `api_timeout=3600` has no TS equivalent.** Use `{ timeout: 25 }` in a poll loop, retrying ~144 times for a 1-hour budget. `catch` generic errors and rethrow on the last iteration (don't try to match a specific status code — any non-`break` outcome means "not ready yet"). See the TypeScript tab at [/task-api/examples/task-enrichment](https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/examples/task-enrichment).
- For batch enrichment, the Group API at [/task-api/group-api](https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/group-api) uses the same snake_case body convention — drop-in familiar.

# Parallel Monitor API — Setup Prompt

You're integrating the **Parallel Monitor API**: continuously track the web for changes relevant to a natural-language query, on a schedule you control. Updates are delivered via webhook (recommended) or pulled via the events endpoint.

## When to use it

Use Monitor when you need to track something continuously — not ask-and-forget. Define a `type=event_stream` monitor with a natural-language query and a `frequency` (1h–30d); when material changes are detected, Parallel POSTs events to your webhook. Good for news tracking, regulatory watch, competitor pricing, executive changes, or anything you'd otherwise build with a cron + diff pipeline. Don't bake dates into the query — Monitor handles freshness automatically. To diff a structured Task Run output across executions instead, use `type=snapshot` (see [Snapshot Monitor](https://docs.parallel.ai/monitor-api/quickstart-snapshot)).

## Best practices

- **Scope queries with intent, not keywords.** `"Notable funding or product launches at OpenAI and Anthropic"` beats `OpenAI OR Anthropic AND funding OR launch`.
- **Pick a frequency that matches signal velocity.** `"1h"` for fast-moving topics, `"1d"` for most news, `"1w"` for slower changes.
- **Prefer webhooks over polling.** Lower latency, no infrastructure to maintain.
- **Pick `processor` for query difficulty.** `"lite"` (default) handles routine queries; `"base"` increases recall and breadth for harder queries, at higher cost.
- **Cancel unused monitors.** Each active monitor consumes usage on every scheduled run.
- **Don't use Monitor for historical research.** It tracks updates from the time of creation. Use [Deep Research](https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/examples/task-deep-research) for retrospective queries.

## Setup

```bash
pip install "parallel-web>=1.0.1"    # Python SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `from parallel import Parallel`
npm install "parallel-web@^1.0.1"    # TypeScript SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `import Parallel from "parallel-web"`

# Treat PARALLEL_API_KEY like a password — load from .env or a secrets manager, don't commit it.
export PARALLEL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Example (Python — adapt to my codebase's language)

```python
from parallel import Parallel

client = Parallel()  # reads PARALLEL_API_KEY from env

# type="event_stream" monitors a search query for material changes.
# frequency: "1h" to "30d" (e.g. "1h", "6h", "1d", "1w", "30d").
# processor: "lite" (default) for routine queries; "base" for harder queries needing higher recall/breadth, at higher cost.
# Don't bake dates into the query — Monitor tracks new updates automatically.
monitor = client.monitor.create(
    type="event_stream",
    frequency="1d",
    processor="base",
    settings={
        "query": "Notable news, funding, product launches, or regulatory events about OpenAI and Anthropic.",
    },
    webhook={
        "url": "https://your-app.example.com/parallel-webhook",
        "event_types": ["monitor.event.detected"],
    },
    metadata={"source": "docs-home"},
)
print(f"Monitor created: {monitor.monitor_id} (status={monitor.status})")

# Webhooks deliver { type: "monitor.event.detected", data: { monitor_id, event: { event_group_id }, metadata } }.
# Use the event_group_id to fetch events for that execution:
events = client.monitor.events(monitor.monitor_id, event_group_id="<event_group_id from webhook>")
for event in events.events:
    print(event.event_id, event.event_date, event.output.content)
# Or list recent events across executions: client.monitor.events(monitor_id, limit=20)
# Pass include_completions=True to also see no-change runs.
# See https://docs.parallel.ai/monitor-api/monitor-events.
```

## TypeScript notes

- Import: `import Parallel from "parallel-web"` (default export).
- Methods are typed: `await client.monitor.create({ type, frequency, settings: { query }, webhook })`. No more low-level `client.post(...)` for monitor calls.
- Body/response fields stay snake_case: `event_types`, `event_group_id`, `monitor_id`, `event_id`. Don't camelCase.
- Wrap in `async` function; await `client.monitor.create(...)` and `client.monitor.events(...)`.
- **Signature verification is production hardening, not required to prototype.** For a first integration you can trust the payload and skip verification. Before you ship to prod: verify the HMAC-SHA256 of `${webhook_id}.${webhook_timestamp}.${raw_body}` using your account webhook secret (get it at **Settings → Webhooks** on platform.parallel.ai; convention: `process.env.PARALLEL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). The `webhook-signature` header is `v1,<base64>` (RFC 4648, space-delimited if rotating). Use the **raw request body** (not parsed JSON) for the HMAC. See [/resources/webhook-setup](https://docs.parallel.ai/resources/webhook-setup) for a ready-to-copy Node.js verifier.

If you're on `/v1alpha/monitors`, see the [Monitor Migration Guide](https://docs.parallel.ai/monitor-api/monitor-migration-guide) — V1 reorganizes the request shape (`settings` wrapper, `advanced_settings`), renames endpoints (Update/Cancel/Trigger), restructures event payloads (stable `event_id`, typed `output` with `basis`), and exposes typed SDK and CLI bindings.

# Parallel FindAll API — Setup Prompt

You're integrating the **Parallel FindAll API** (beta): discover and verify entities matching criteria you describe in plain language.

## When to use it

Use FindAll to build a list of companies, people, or other entities from scratch — you describe what you're looking for in natural language, it searches the web, evaluates candidates against your match conditions, and returns verified matches. If you already have the list and just need to populate fields about each entity, use the Task API (enrichment) instead. If you require results in seconds rather than verified matches, use Entity Search, FindAll's real-time counterpart, instead.

## Setup

```bash
pip install "parallel-web>=1.0.1"    # Python SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `from parallel import Parallel`
npm install "parallel-web@^1.0.1"    # TypeScript SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `import Parallel from "parallel-web"`

# Treat PARALLEL_API_KEY like a password — load from .env or a secrets manager, don't commit it.
export PARALLEL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Example (Python — adapt to my codebase's language)

```python
import time
from parallel import Parallel

client = Parallel()  # reads PARALLEL_API_KEY from env

# Tip: start with generator="preview" to test your query (~10 candidates, low cost).
# Generators: preview (test), base (broad/common matches), core (specific),
#             pro (rare/hard-to-find matches, most thorough)
# match_limit must be between 5 and 1000.
# Write match_conditions as concrete, testable predicates (not tautologies).
findall_run = client.beta.findall.create(
    objective="Find all AI startups that raised Series A in 2024",
    entity_type="companies",
    match_conditions=[
        {
            "name": "ai_core_product_check",
            "description": "Company's core product or platform must be AI-focused (not merely AI-adjacent).",
        },
        {
            "name": "series_a_2024_check",
            "description": "Company must have announced a Series A funding round between 2024-01-01 and 2024-12-31.",
        },
    ],
    generator="core",
    match_limit=20,
)

# Poll until the run is no longer active, then fetch results.
# For a production integration, prefer SSE or webhooks — see https://docs.parallel.ai/findall-api/features/findall-sse.
while client.beta.findall.retrieve(findall_id=findall_run.findall_id).status.is_active:
    time.sleep(5)

result = client.beta.findall.result(findall_id=findall_run.findall_id)

for candidate in result.candidates:
    print(f"{candidate.name}: {candidate.url}")
    print(f"  {candidate.description}")
```

## TypeScript notes

- Import: `import Parallel from "parallel-web"` (default export).
- Methods live under `client.beta.findall.*` (four-deep). Request/response fields stay snake_case: `entity_type`, `match_conditions`, `match_limit`, `findall_id`, `status.is_active`, `candidate.name` / `.url` / `.description`.
- `retrieve()` and `result()` take a **positional string** id, not an object param: `await client.beta.findall.retrieve(findallId)`.
- **Prefer SSE over polling** for production: `const stream = await client.beta.findall.events(findallId); for await (const event of stream) { ... }`. Events are a discriminated union keyed on `event.type` (`"findall.candidate.matched"` carries `event.candidate`; `"findall.status"` carries the run status; terminal states set `status.is_active: false` — break the loop there).

# Parallel Entity Search — Setup Prompt

You're integrating **Parallel Entity Search** (beta): a fast, synchronous people-and-company search. Describe the people or companies you want in plain language and get back a set of matching results in seconds.

## When to use it

Use Entity Search for real-time, human-in-the-loop, and latency-sensitive workflows — producing a starting set of people or companies to evaluate, enrich, or pass into deeper research. It is optimized for recall and speed: depending on the specificity of the objective, some results may not satisfy every requirement, so filter or review them downstream. For precision — verified, enriched, cited list building — use FindAll instead, which checks every result against your match conditions.

## Setup

```bash
pip install "parallel-web>=1.0.0"    # Python SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `from parallel import Parallel`
npm install "parallel-web@^1.0.0"    # TypeScript SDK — package is "parallel-web", import as `import Parallel from "parallel-web"`

# Treat PARALLEL_API_KEY like a password — load from .env or a secrets manager, don't commit it.
export PARALLEL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Example (Python — adapt to my codebase's language)

```python
from parallel import Parallel

client = Parallel()  # reads PARALLEL_API_KEY from env

# entity_type is "people" or "companies".
# objective is a natural-language description of the people or companies you want.
# match_limit must be between 5 and 1000 (default 100).
response = client.beta.findall.entity_search(
    entity_type="companies",
    objective="AI startups that raised Series A in 2024",
    match_limit=100,
)

# Synchronous — results come back in the response. No polling, streaming, or webhooks.
for entity in response.entities:
    print(f"{entity.name}: {entity.url}")
    print(f"  {entity.description}")
```

## TypeScript notes

- Import: `import Parallel from "parallel-web"` (default export).
- Methods live under `client.beta.findall.*`. The call is `client.beta.findall.entitySearch({ ... })` (camelCase method); request/response fields stay snake_case: `entity_type`, `objective`, `match_limit`, `entity_set_id`, `entity.name` / `.url` / `.description`.
- Synchronous — results are returned directly in the response; there's nothing to poll.
