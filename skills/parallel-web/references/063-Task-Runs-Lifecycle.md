# Task Runs Lifecycle
> Understanding how Tasks Runs are created, processed, and returned

Task runs are stateful objects, which means that creating a Task Run and retrieving its results are separate calls to the API. Each Task Run is an independent instance that progresses through a series of states from `queued` to `completed`. This asynchronous design enables efficient scaling of web research operations.
### Task Run States
| Status | Description | Can Transition To |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `queued` | Task created and waiting for processing | `running`, `failed` |
| `running` | Task actively being processed | `completed`, `failed` |
| `completed` | Task successfully completed with results available | (Terminal state) |
| `failed` | Task encountered an error | (Terminal state) |
\*\*Note\*\*: Running time varies by processor type and task complexity.
## Creating a Task Run
The basic requirements of a task run are:
\* Input data (string or JSON object)
\* A processor selection
\* Output schema (optional but recommended)
Optionally, you can include:
\* Input schema (optionally used to validate run input)
\* Metadata (for tracking or organizing runs)
A Task Run, once created, can be identified by its `run\_id`. A Task Run Result can be accessed once the Task Run status becomes `completed`.
## Rate Limits
The Task API enforces a limit of \*\*2,000 requests per minute\*\* per API key. This limit applies across all POST and GET requests and helps ensure consistent performance for all users.
When you exceed this limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.
## Examples
### Completed Status Example
```json theme={"system"}
{
"run\_id": "b0679f70-195e-4f42-8b8a-b8242a0c69c7",
"status": "completed",
"is\_active": false,
"result": {
"population": "29.5 million (2022 estimate)",
"growth\_rate": "1.4% annually",
"major\_cities": [
"Houston",
"Dallas",
"San Antonio"
]
},
"result\_url": "https://api.parallel.ai/v1/tasks/runs/b0679f70-195e-4f42-8b8a-b8242a0c69c7/result",
"warnings": null,
"errors": null,
"processor": "core",
"metadata": null,
"created\_at": "2025-04-08T04:28:59.913464",
"modified\_at": "2025-04-08T04:29:32.651298"
}
```
### Failed Status Example
If a Task Run encounters an error, the status will be set to `failed` and details will be available in the `errors` field:
```json theme={"system"}
{
"run\_id": "b0679f70-195e-4f42-8b8a-b8242a0c69c7",
"status": "failed",
"is\_active": false,
"result": null,
"result\_url": null,
"warnings": null,
"errors": [
{
"code": "processing\_error",
"message": "Unable to process task due to invalid input format",
"details": {
"field": "input",
"reason": "Expected JSON object but received string"
}
}
],
"processor": "core",
"metadata": null,
"created\_at": "2025-04-08T04:28:59.913464",
"modified\_at": "2025-04-08T04:29:01.234567"
}
```
