# Search API Quickstart
> Execute natural language web searches and retrieve LLM-optimized excerpts with the Parallel Search API

For AI agents: a documentation index is available at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt). The full text of all docs is at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt). You may also fetch any page as Markdown by appending `.md` to its URL or sending `Accept: text/markdown`.

The \*\*Search API\*\* takes a natural language objective and returns relevant excerpts
optimized for LLMs, replacing multiple keyword searches with a single call for broad or
complex queries.
\*\*Available via MCP\*\*: Search is available as a tool as part of the Parallel Search MCP. Our MCP is optimized for best practices on Search and Extract usage. [Start here](/integrations/mcp/search-mcp) with MCP for your use case. If you're interested in direct use of the API, follow the steps below.

\*\*Looking for people or companies?\*\* [Entity Search](/findall-api/entity-search) is a fast, synchronous people-and-company search — the real-time counterpart to FindAll — returning a set of matching results in seconds. It is distinct from the Search API, which retrieves pages and excerpts across the whole web.
## 1. Set Up Prerequisites
Generate your API key on [Platform](https://platform.parallel.ai). Then, set up with the TypeScript SDK, Python SDK or with cURL:
```bash cURL theme={"system"}
echo "Install curl and jq via brew, apt, or your favorite package manager"
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"
```
```bash Python theme={"system"}
pip install parallel-web
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"
```
```bash TypeScript theme={"system"}
npm install parallel-web
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"
```
## 2. Execute Your First Search
### Sample Request
```bash cURL theme={"system"}
curl https://api.parallel.ai/v1/search \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "x-api-key: $PARALLEL\_API\_KEY" \
-d '{
"objective": "Find latest information about Parallel Web Systems. Focus on new product releases, benchmarks, or company announcements.",
"search\_queries": [
"Parallel Web Systems products",
"Parallel Web Systems announcements"
]
}'
```
```python Python theme={"system"}
import os
from parallel import Parallel
client = Parallel(api\_key=os.environ["PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"])
search = client.search(
objective="Find latest information about Parallel Web Systems. Focus on new product releases, benchmarks, or company announcements.",
search\_queries=[
"Parallel Web Systems products",
"Parallel Web Systems announcements"
],
)
for result in search.results:
print(f"{result.title}: {result.url}")
for excerpt in result.excerpts:
print(excerpt[:200])
```
```typescript TypeScript theme={"system"}
import Parallel from "parallel-web";
const client = new Parallel({ apiKey: process.env.PARALLEL\_API\_KEY });
async function main() {
const search = await client.search({
objective: "Find latest information about Parallel Web Systems. Focus on new product releases, benchmarks, or company announcements.",
search\_queries: [
"Parallel Web Systems products",
"Parallel Web Systems announcements"
],
});
for (const result of search.results) {
console.log(`${result.title}: ${result.url}`);
for (const excerpt of result.excerpts) {
console.log(excerpt.slice(0, 200));
}
}
}
main().catch(console.error);
```

This request uses the default `advanced` mode (\~3s, highest quality). For latency-sensitive use cases, add `"mode": "turbo"` as a top-level request field for a p50 of 200ms at a lower cost. The rest of the request stays the same. See [Search Modes](/search/modes) for a runnable example.
### Sample Response
The API returns a JSON response with the following structure. The SDK examples above iterate over `results` to print each result's title, URL, and excerpts. If any non-fatal input adjustments or validation warnings have occurred, they will be in the warnings field.
