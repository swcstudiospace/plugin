Parallel Chat is a web research API that returns OpenAI ChatCompletions compatible streaming text and JSON.
The Chat API supports multiple models—from the `speed` model for low latency across a
broad range of use cases, to research models (`lite`, `base`, `core`) for deeper research-grade outputs
where you can afford to wait longer for even more comprehensive responses with full [research basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis) support.
{" "}
\*\*Beta Notice\*\*: Parallel Chat is in beta. We provide a rate limit of 300 requests
per minute for the Chat API out of the box. [Contact us](mailto:support@parallel.ai)
for production capacity.{" "}
## Choosing the Right Model
The Chat API supports both the `speed` model for
low latency applications and research models for deeper outputs.
Research models (`lite`, `base`, `core`) are Chat API wrappers over our [Task API processors](/task-api/guides/choose-a-processor),
providing the same research capabilities along with basis in an OpenAI-compatible interface.
| Model | Best For | Basis Support | Latency (TTFT) |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| `speed` | Low latency across a broad range of use cases | No | \~3s |
| `lite` | Simple lookups, basic metadata | Yes | 10-60s |
| `base` | Standard enrichments, factual queries | Yes | 15-100s |
| `core` | Complex research, multi-source synthesis | Yes | 60s-5min |
Use `speed` for low latency across a broad range of use cases.
Use research models (`lite`, `base`, `core`) for more research-intensive workflows
where you can afford to wait longer for an even deeper response with citations,
reasoning, and confidence levels via the [research basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis).
## 1. Set up Prerequisites
The Chat API is fully compatible with the OpenAI SDK — just swap the base URL and API key. Generate your API key on [Platform](https://platform.parallel.ai), then install the OpenAI SDK:
```bash Python theme={"system"}
pip install openai
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="your-api-key"
```
```bash TypeScript theme={"system"}
npm install openai
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="your-api-key"
```
```bash cURL theme={"system"}
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="your-api-key"
```
## Performance and Rate Limits
Speed is optimized for interactive applications requiring low latency responses:
\* \*\*Performance\*\*: With `stream=true`, achieves 3 second p50 TTFT (median time to first token)
\* \*\*Default Rate Limit\*\*: 300 requests per minute
\* \*\*Use Cases\*\*: Chat interfaces, interactive tools
For research based tasks where latency is not the primary concern, use one of the research models.
For production deployments requiring higher rate limits, [contact our team](https://www.parallel.ai).

main();
```
## System Prompt
You can provide a custom system prompt to control the AI's behavior and response style by including it in the messages array with `"role": "system"` as the first message in your request.
## Using Research Models
When you use research models (`lite`, `base`, or `core`) instead of `speed`, the
Chat API provides research-grade outputs with
full [research basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis) support.
The basis includes citations, reasoning, and confidence levels for each response.
### Example with Research Model
```bash cURL theme={"system"}
curl -N https://api.parallel.ai/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PARALLEL\_API\_KEY" \
-d '{
"model": "base",
"messages": [
{ "role": "user", "content": "What is the founding date and headquarters of Parallel Web Systems?" }
],
"stream": false
}'
```
```python Python theme={"system"}
import os
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
api\_key=os.environ["PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"],
base\_url="https://api.parallel.ai" # Parallel's API endpoint
)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="base", # Research model for deeper output
messages=[
{"role": "user", "content": "What is the founding date and headquarters of Parallel Web Systems?"}
],
)
# Access the response content
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
# Access the research basis (citations, reasoning, confidence)
print(response.basis)
```
```typescript TypeScript theme={"system"}
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.PARALLEL\_API\_KEY,
baseURL: "https://api.parallel.ai", // Parallel's API endpoint
});
async function main() {
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
model: "base", // Research model for deeper output
messages: [
{
role: "user",
content: "What is the founding date and headquarters of Parallel Web Systems?",
},
],
});
// Access the response content
console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
// Access the research basis (citations, reasoning, confidence)
console.log((response as any).basis);
}
main();
```
For complete details on the research basis structure, including per-element basis for arrays, see the [Basis documentation](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis).
## OpenAI SDK Compatibility
\*\*Research Basis via OpenAI SDK\*\*: When using task processors (`lite`, `base`, `core`) with the Chat API, the response includes a `basis` field with citations, reasoning, and confidence levels. Access it via `response.basis` in Python or `(response as any).basis` in TypeScript. See [Basis documentation](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis) for details.
### Important OpenAI Compatibility Limitations
#### API Behavior
Here are the most substantial differences from using OpenAI:
\* Multimodal input (images/audio) is not supported and will be ignored.
\* Prompt caching is not supported.
\* Most unsupported fields are silently ignored rather than producing errors. These are all documented below.
