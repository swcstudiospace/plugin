The Task API may return various warnings and errors during operation. This page documents the possible error types you might encounter when using the API.
## Errors
Errors result in a failure to process your request and are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes (4xx or 5xx).
| Error | Description | Resolution |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \*\*Invalid JSON Schema\*\* | The JSON schema provided in the task spec for input or output is invalid. | Review your schema against JSON Schema specifications and ensure it follows the required format. |
| \*\*Task Spec + Input Too Long\*\* | The combined task specification and input exceeds 25,000 characters. | Reduce the size of your task spec or input data. Consider splitting into multiple tasks if necessary. |
| \*\*Too-Complex Output Schema\*\* | The output schema exceeds allowed complexity in terms of nesting depth or number of fields. | Simplify your output schema by reducing nested levels to 3 or less. |
## Warnings
Warnings indicate potential issues that don't prevent the request from being processed but may affect results.
| Warning | Description | Resolution |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \*\*Input Fails Validation\*\* | The provided input does not conform to the input schema. | Verify your input against the schema requirements and make necessary adjustments. |
| \*\*Task Spec + Input Over Size Limit\*\* | The combined task specification and input exceeds the character limit. | Consider optimizing your input or task spec for better performance. |
| \*\*Too Many Output Fields\*\* | The number of requested output fields exceeds the recommended limit. | Consider reducing the number of output fields. |
## Warning Handling
The Task API uses a warning system to provide guidance without blocking execution. Warnings are generated during validation and can be handled in two ways:
### Basis Properties
It is recommended to use `FieldBasis` in the run output rather than requesting similar information in the output schema.
This means you've included fields like `citations`, `reasoning`, or `sources` in your output schema, but this information is \*\*already provided automatically\*\* in every Task Run result through the [Basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis) feature.
\*\*What is Basis?\*\* Every Task Run result includes a `basis` array containing citations, reasoning, and confidence levels for each output field. This is provided automatically; you don't need to request it in your schema.
\*\*Why not include these in the output schema?\*\*
\* \*\*Redundant\*\*: You'll get duplicate data, wasting tokens and processing
\* \*\*Less structured\*\*: The automatic Basis provides properly structured citations with URLs and excerpts
\* \*\*Less reliable\*\*: Asking the model to generate its own citations may produce less accurate results than the built-in citation tracking
The following field names trigger this warning:
\* `citations`
\* `confidence`
\* `evidence`
\* `reasoning`
\* `source`
\* `sources`
\* `source\_urls`
\*\*Instead of this:\*\*
```json theme={"system"}
{
"properties": {
"company\_name": { "type": "string" },
"reasoning": { "type": "string" },
"sources": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
}
}
```
\*\*Do this:\*\*
```json theme={"system"}
{
"properties": {
"company\_name": { "type": "string" }
}
}
```
Then access `output.basis` in the response to get citations, reasoning, and confidence for each field. See [Accessing Research Basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis) for details.
## Error Reference
| Status Code | Meaning | Retry? | Description | Resolution Approach |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \*\*401\*\* | Unauthorized | No | Invalid or missing credentials | Verify API key and authentication headers |
| \*\*402\*\* | Payment Required | No | Insufficient credit in account | See [402 Troubleshooting](#402-payment-required-troubleshooting) below |
| \*\*403\*\* | Forbidden | No | Invalid processor in request | Check processor availability and permissions |
| \*\*404\*\* | Not Found | No | Run ID or resource not found | Verify run ID and resource existence |
| \*\*408\*\* | Request Timeout | Yes | Synchronous request timed out | Use asynchronous polling |
| \*\*422\*\* | Unprocessable Content | No | Request validation failed | Review error details and validate schema |
| \*\*429\*\* | Too Many Requests | Yes | Rate limited or quota exceeded | Implement exponential backoff |
| \*\*500\*\* | Internal Server Error | Yes | Server-side processing error | Retry with backoff, contact support if persistent |
| \*\*502\*\* | Bad Gateway | Yes | Upstream service error | Retry, usually temporary |
| \*\*503\*\* | Service Unavailable | Yes | Service temporarily unavailable | Retry with backoff |
## Error Response Format
All errors return a consistent JSON structure:
```json theme={"system"}
{
"error": {
"message": "Human-readable error description",
"detail": {
// Additional error-specific information
}
}
}
```
For validation errors (422), the `detail` field contains specific information about which fields failed validation and why.
## 402 Payment Required Troubleshooting
A 402 error indicates your account has insufficient credits to process the request. This can occur even if your account shows a positive balance due to \*\*in-flight balance reservations\*\*.
### Understanding In-Flight Balance
When you submit a task, the system reserves credits for the estimated cost before processing begins. This reservation is called the "in-flight balance." Your \*\*available balance\*\* equals your \*\*total balance\*\* minus the \*\*in-flight balance\*\* from all currently running tasks.
\*\*Example scenario:\*\*
\* Account balance: \$10.00
\* 5 running `pro` tasks (each reserves \~$0.10): $0.50 reserved
\* Available balance: \$9.50
If your available balance is insufficient for a new task, you'll receive a 402 error even though your total balance appears positive.
### Common Causes
| Cause | Solution |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \*\*Multiple concurrent tasks\*\* | Running many tasks simultaneously reserves credits for each. Wait for some to complete or reduce concurrency. |
| \*\*Higher-tier processors\*\* | `ultra` and `pro` processors reserve more credits than `base` or `lite`. Consider using lower-tier processors for less complex tasks. |
| \*\*Insufficient account balance\*\* | Add credits at [platform.parallel.ai](https://platform.parallel.ai). |
| \*\*Large task groups\*\* | Task groups reserve credits for all runs upfront. Split into smaller batches if needed. |
### How to Resolve
1. \*\*Check your balance\*\*: View your current balance and usage at [platform.parallel.ai](https://platform.parallel.ai)
2. \*\*Wait for tasks to complete\*\*: In-flight reservations are released when tasks finish
3. \*\*Add credits\*\*: Top up your account balance if genuinely low
4. \*\*Reduce concurrency\*\*: Lower the number of parallel tasks to reduce reserved credits
5. \*\*Use lower-tier processors\*\*: Reserve fewer credits per task by using `base` or `lite` processors where appropriate
For high-volume workloads, monitor your available balance (not just total balance) and implement backoff logic when approaching limits. See [Pricing](https://parallel.ai/pricing) for processor costs.
