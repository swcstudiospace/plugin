- name: Search
description: >-
Search returns ranked URLs with extended excerpts suitable for LLM
consumption. Inputs are a natural-language objective and optional keyword
queries. Source policies allow including or excluding specific domains and
have configurable output sizes. The returned extended snippets contain
dense, relevant information from relevant pages.
- Result: ranked list with URL, title, and long text excerpts
- name: Extract
description: >-
Extract returns excerpts or full content from one or more URLs. Inputs are
a list of URLs and an optional search objective and keyword queries. The
returned excerpts or full content is formatted as markdown and suitable
for LLM consumption.
- Result: excerpts or full content from the URL formatted as markdown
- name: Tasks
description: >-
The Task API executes web research and extraction tasks. Clients submit a
natural-language objective with an optional input schema; the service
plans retrieval, fetches relevant URLs, and returns outputs that conform
to a provided or inferred JSON schema. Supports deep research style
queries and can return rich structured JSON outputs. Processors trade-off
between cost, latency, and quality. Each processor supports calibrated
confidences.
- Output metadata: citations, excerpts, reasoning, and confidence per
field
Task Groups enable batch execution of many independent Task runs with
group-level monitoring and failure handling.
- Submit hundreds or thousands of Tasks as a single group
- Observe group progress and receive results as they complete
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Add tasks to an existing group while it is running
- Group-level retry and error aggregation
- name: FindAll
description: >-
The FindAll API discovers and evaluates entities that match complex
criteria from natural language objectives. Submit a high-level goal and
the service automatically generates structured match conditions, discovers
relevant candidates, and evaluates each against the criteria. Returns
comprehensive results with detailed reasoning, citations, and confidence
scores for each match decision. Streaming events and webhooks are
supported.
- name: Monitor
description: >-
The Monitor API watches the web for material changes on a fixed frequency.
Each monitor runs once on creation and then on its configured schedule,
emitting events when meaningful changes are detected.
- `event\_stream` monitors track a search query and emit an event for each
new material change.
- `snapshot` monitors track a specific task run's output and emit an event
when the output changes.
Results can be polled via the events endpoint or delivered via webhooks.
- name: Chat API (Beta)
description: >-
The Chat API provides a programmatic chat-style text generation interface.
It accepts a sequence of messages and returns model responses. Intended
for assistant-like interactions and evaluation. Streaming responses are
supported.
- name: Responses API
description: >-
An OpenAI-Responses-compatible interface for answers grounded in live web
research, with URL citations. Point any Responses-API client — the OpenAI
Python SDK, OpenAI TypeScript SDK, the Agents SDK, or raw HTTP — at
`https://api.parallel.ai` with your Parallel API key, set `model` to
`parallel`, and call `/v1/responses`.
- `input` accepts a plain string or an array of role/content messages
(canonical OpenAI shape; text content only).
- `reasoning.effort` (`low`/`medium`/`high`) controls how much research is
performed, trading response time for answer quality.
- Multi-turn via `previous\_response\_id`.
- Structured outputs via `text.format = {"type": "json\_schema", "name":
..., "schema": {...}}`.
- Streaming (`stream=true`) emits the standard OpenAI Responses SSE
lifecycle: `response.created` and `response.in\_progress`, then output item
/ content part / text delta events with URL-citation annotations, the
matching `\*.done` events, and a terminal `response.completed` — or
`response.failed` if the request fails mid-stream.
