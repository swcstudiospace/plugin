# Using the Responses API Directly
> Call the Responses API directly: single questions, deep research, dataset enrichment, and follow-ups
The simplest way to use the Responses API is to call it directly: your application asks a
question, the API researches the live web and returns a synthesized, cited answer. This page
covers the common direct-call patterns.
## Ask a question
Use `low` effort for simple fact retrieval — it returns in a few seconds:
```bash cURL theme={"system"}
curl https://api.parallel.ai/v1/responses \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PARALLEL\_API\_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"model": "parallel",
"input": "Who is the current CEO of the largest cloud provider by revenue?",
"reasoning": {"effort": "low"}
}'
```
```python Python theme={"system"}
import os
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
api\_key=os.environ["PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"],
base\_url="https://api.parallel.ai/v1",
)
response = client.responses.create(
model="parallel",
input="Who is the current CEO of the largest cloud provider by revenue?",
reasoning={"effort": "low"},
)
print(response.output\_text)
```
```typescript TypeScript theme={"system"}
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.PARALLEL\_API\_KEY,
baseURL: "https://api.parallel.ai/v1",
});
const response = await client.responses.create({
model: "parallel",
input: "Who is the current CEO of the largest cloud provider by revenue?",
reasoning: { effort: "low" },
});
console.log(response.output\_text);
```
## Ask a deep-research question
The `high` tier runs extensive multi-step searching and synthesis and returns in roughly
30–60 seconds. Give your client timeout headroom, and consider
[streaming](/responses-api/features/streaming-events) for a connection acknowledgment while
research runs:
```python Python theme={"system"}
client = OpenAI(
api\_key=os.environ["PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"],
base\_url="https://api.parallel.ai/v1",
timeout=120.0, # allow headroom for high-effort research
)
response = client.responses.create(
model="parallel",
input="Which universities did the 2018 Fields Medalists get their PhDs from?",
reasoning={"effort": "high"},
)
print(response.output\_text)
```
```typescript TypeScript theme={"system"}
const client = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.PARALLEL\_API\_KEY,
baseURL: "https://api.parallel.ai/v1",
timeout: 120\_000, // allow headroom for high-effort research
});
const response = await client.responses.create({
model: "parallel",
input: "Which universities did the 2018 Fields Medalists get their PhDs from?",
reasoning: { effort: "high" },
});
console.log(response.output\_text);
```
The Responses API is synchronous and designed for research that fits an interactive latency
budget. For long-running deep research (minutes, not seconds) with per-field evidence and
webhooks, use the [Task API Deep Research](/task-api/examples/task-deep-research) flow.
## Enrich a dataset
Each row becomes one request: pass the entity as the question, use
[Structured Outputs](/responses-api/features/structured-outputs) to shape the answer, and
run rows concurrently — wall-clock time stays close to a single request instead of the sum.
```python Python theme={"system"}
import asyncio
import json
import os
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
client = AsyncOpenAI(
api\_key=os.environ["PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"],
base\_url="https://api.parallel.ai/v1",
)
SCHEMA = {
"type": "json\_schema",
"name": "company\_facts",
"schema": {
"type": "object",
"properties": {
"founding\_year": {
"type": "integer",
"description": "Year the company was founded, as a four-digit number",
},
"headquarters\_city": {
"type": "string",
"description": "City of the company's current headquarters",
},
"ceo": {
"type": "string",
"description": "Full name of the current CEO",
},
},
"required": ["founding\_year", "headquarters\_city", "ceo"],
"additionalProperties": False,
},
}
async def enrich(company: str) -> dict:
response = await client.responses.create(
model="parallel",
input=f"Find the founding year, headquarters city, and current CEO of {company}.",
reasoning={"effort": "low"},
text={"format": SCHEMA},
metadata={"company": company},
)
return {"company": company, \*\*json.loads(response.output\_text)}
async def main():
companies = ["Anthropic", "Vercel", "Datadog"]
rows = await asyncio.gather(\*(enrich(c) for c in companies))
for row in rows:
print(row)
asyncio.run(main())
```
```typescript TypeScript theme={"system"}
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.PARALLEL\_API\_KEY,
baseURL: "https://api.parallel.ai/v1",
});
const SCHEMA = {
type: "json\_schema" as const,
name: "company\_facts",
schema: {
type: "object",
properties: {
founding\_year: {
type: "integer",
description: "Year the company was founded, as a four-digit number",
},
headquarters\_city: {
type: "string",
description: "City of the company's current headquarters",
},
ceo: { type: "string", description: "Full name of the current CEO" },
},
required: ["founding\_year", "headquarters\_city", "ceo"],
additionalProperties: false,
},
};
async function enrich(company: string) {
const response = await client.responses.create({
model: "parallel",
input: `Find the founding year, headquarters city, and current CEO of ${company}.`,
reasoning: { effort: "low" },
text: { format: SCHEMA },
metadata: { company },
});
return { company, ...JSON.parse(response.output\_text) };
}
const companies = ["Anthropic", "Vercel", "Datadog"];
const rows = await Promise.all(companies.map(enrich));
console.log(rows);
```
Tips for enrichment at scale:
\* \*\*Put the complete question in `input`\*\*, including qualifiers ("current", units, date
ranges) — each request is self-contained.
\* \*\*Use `metadata`\*\* to tag each request with your row id; it is echoed back on the response.
\* \*\*Back off and retry on `429` responses.\*\*
\* For large batches with per-field citations and confidence ratings, consider the
[Task API Enrichment](/task-api/examples/task-enrichment) flow, which is purpose-built for
that workload.
## Ask follow-up questions
Chain turns with [Statefulness](/responses-api/features/statefulness): pass the previous
response's `id` and follow-ups inherit the conversation context. Tiers can vary across
turns — open with a `high`-effort research question and ask cheap `low`-effort follow-ups.
```python Python theme={"system"}
first = client.responses.create(
model="parallel",
input="What are the leading commercial fusion energy startups?",
reasoning={"effort": "high"},
)
follow\_up = client.responses.create(
model="parallel",
input="Which of them has raised the most funding?",
reasoning={"effort": "low"},
previous\_response\_id=first.id,
)
```
