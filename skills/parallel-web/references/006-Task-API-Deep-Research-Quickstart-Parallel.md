# Task API Deep Research Quickstart - Parallel

Source: https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/examples/task-deep-research

## [​](#overview) Overview

Deep Research is designed for open-ended research questions where you don’t have structured input data to enrich. Instead of bringing data to enhance, you bring a research question or topic, and the Task API conducts comprehensive multi-step web exploration to deliver analyst-grade intelligence.
This powerful capability compresses hours of manual research into minutes, delivering high-quality intelligence at scale. Optimized within the `pro` and `ultra` [processor families](/task-api/guides/choose-a-processor), Deep Research transforms natural language research queries into comprehensive reports complete with inline citations and verification.

For faster turnaround, use fast processors like `pro-fast` or `ultra-fast`. These deliver 2-5x faster response times while maintaining high accuracy—ideal for interactive applications or when you need quicker results. See [Standard vs Fast Processors](/task-api/guides/choose-a-processor#standard-vs-fast-processors) for details.

This guide focuses on **Deep Research**. If you have structured data you want to enrich with web intelligence (like adding columns to a spreadsheet), see our [Enrichment guide](/task-api/examples/task-enrichment).

## [​](#how-deep-research-works) How Deep Research Works

With Deep Research, the system automatically:

1. Interprets your research intent from natural language
2. Conducts multi-step web exploration across authoritative sources
3. Synthesizes findings into structured data or markdown reports
4. Provides citations and confidence levels for verification

## [​](#key-features) Key Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Simply describe what you want to research in plain language—no need for structured data or predefined schemas.
- **Declarative Approach**: Specify what intelligence you need, and the system handles the complex orchestration of research, exploration, and synthesis.
- **Flexible Output Structure**: Choose between `auto` schema mode (automatically structured JSON), `text` mode (markdown reports) or pre-specified structured JSON schema based on your needs.
- **Comprehensive Intelligence**: Multi-step research across authoritative sources with granular citations, reasoning, and confidence levels for every finding.

Long-Running Tasks: Deep Research can take up to 45 minutes to complete. See [Polling vs Webhooks vs SSE](#polling-vs-webhooks-vs-sse) below for how to handle async results.

## [​](#creating-a-deep-research-task) Creating a Deep Research Task

Deep Research accepts any input schema as input, including plain-text strings.
The more specific and detailed your input, the better the research results would be.

**Input size restriction**: Deep Research is optimized for concise research
prompts and is not meant for long context inputs. Keep your input under
**15,000 characters** for optimal performance and results.

Deep Research supports two output formats to meet different integration needs:

### [​](#auto-schema) Auto Schema

Specifying auto schema mode in the Task API output schema triggers Deep Research
and ensures well-structured outputs, without the need to specify a desired output structure.
The final schema type will follow a [JSONSchema](/api-reference/tasks/create-task-run#body-task-spec-output-schema)
format and will be determined by the processor automatically.
Auto schema mode is the default mode when using `pro` and `ultra` line of processors.
This format is ideal for programmatic processing, data analysis, and integration with other systems.

from parallel import Parallel

client = Parallel(api_key="PARALLEL_API_KEY")

task_run = client.task_run.create(
    input="Create a comprehensive market research report on the HVAC industry in the USA including an analysis of recent M&A activity and other relevant details.",
    processor="ultra"
)
print(f"Run ID: {task_run.run_id}")

run_result = client.task_run.result(task_run.run_id, api_timeout=3600)
print(run_result.output)
```

```
import Parallel from "parallel-web";

const client = new Parallel({
  apiKey: process.env["PARALLEL_API_KEY"],
});

async function main() {
  const taskRun = await client.taskRun.create({
    input:
      "Create a comprehensive market research report on the HVAC industry in the USA including an analysis of recent M&A activity and other relevant details.",
    processor: "ultra",
  });

  console.log(`Run ID: ${taskRun.run_id}`);

  // Poll for results with 25-second timeout, retry up to 144 times (1 hour total)
  let runResult;
  for (let i = 0; i < 144; i++) {
    try {
      runResult = await client.taskRun.result(taskRun.run_id, { timeout: 25 });
      break;
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === 143) throw error; // Last attempt failed
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }
  }

  console.log(runResult.output);
}

  "input": "Create a comprehensive market research report on the HVAC industry in the USA including an analysis of recent M&A activity and other relevant details.",
  "processor": "ultra"
}'
```

### [​](#text-schema) Text Schema

Specifying text schema mode in the Task API output schema triggers Deep Research with a markdown report output format.
The generated result will contain extensive research formatted into a markdown report with in-line citations.
This format is perfect for human-readable content as well as LLM ingestion.
To provide guidance on the output, use the description field when specifying text schema. This
allows users to steer the report generated towards a certain direction like control over the length or the content
of the report.

### [​](#sample-response) Sample Response

**Important**: The response below shows the **final completed result** after
Deep Research has finished. When you first create a task, you’ll receive an
immediate response with `"status": "running"`. You’ll need to poll the task or
use [webhooks](/task-api/webhooks) to get the final structured research output
shown below.

Below is a shortened sample response using the `auto` schema. The complete response contained 124 content fields, with 610 total citations for this Task.

Deep Research returns a response which includes the `content` and the `basis`, as with other [Task API](/task-api/guides/execute-task-run) executions. The key difference is that the `basis` object in an `auto` mode output contains Nested FieldBasis.

### [​](#nested-fieldbasis) Nested FieldBasis

In `text` mode, FieldBasis is not nested. It contains a list of citations (with
URLs and excerpts) for all sites visited during research. The most relevant citations
are included at the base of the report itself, with inline references.

In `auto` mode, the [Basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis) object maps each output field (including nested fields) with supporting evidence. This ensures that every output, including nested output fields, has citations, excerpts, confidence levels and reasoning.
For nested fields, the basis uses dot notation for indexing:

- `key_players.0` for the first item in a key players array
- `industry_overview.growth_cagr` for nested object fields
- `market_trends.2.description` for nested arrays with objects

## [​](#polling-vs-webhooks-vs-sse) Polling vs Webhooks vs SSE

The Task API is asynchronous—when you create a task, it returns immediately with a `run_id` while processing continues in the background. There are three ways to get results:

| Method | What It Does | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Polling** | Your code repeatedly calls the API to check if the task is done | Simple integrations, scripts, testing |
| **Webhooks** | Parallel sends an HTTP request to your server when the task completes | Production apps with backend servers |
| **SSE** | Stream real-time progress updates as the task runs | Interactive UIs, monitoring progress |

### [​](#polling) Polling

**How it works:** After creating a task, repeatedly check its status until it completes.

```
import time

# Create task
task_run = client.task_run.create(input="...", processor="ultra")

# Poll until complete
while True:
    status = client.task_run.retrieve(task_run.run_id)
    if status.status == "completed":
        break
    if status.status == "failed":
        raise Exception(f"Task failed: {status.error}")
    time.sleep(5)  # Wait 5 seconds between checks

# Get the result
result = client.task_run.result(task_run.run_id)
```

**Key points:**

- Simplest approach—no infrastructure needed
- Use `retrieve()` to check status, then `result()` when complete
- The `result()` method also blocks until complete if you prefer a one-liner: `client.task_run.result(run_id, api_timeout=3600)`

### [​](#webhooks) Webhooks

**How it works:** Provide a webhook URL when creating the task. Parallel sends a POST request to your URL when the task finishes.

```
task_run = client.task_run.create(
    input="...",
    processor="ultra",
    webhook={
        "url": "https://your-server.com/webhooks/parallel",
        "event_types": ["task_run.status"]
    },
)
```

**Key points:**

- Webhooks notify you when the task **completes**—they don’t send the actual results
- After receiving the webhook, call `result()` to retrieve the output data
- Requires a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint
- See [Webhooks documentation](/task-api/webhooks) for setup and verification

**Important:** Webhooks are a notification mechanism, not a data delivery mechanism. The webhook payload contains the task status and metadata, but you must make a separate API call to retrieve the actual research results.

### [​](#server-sent-events-sse) Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**How it works:** Connect to a streaming endpoint to receive real-time progress updates as the task runs.

```
# First, create task with events enabled
curl -X POST "https://api.parallel.ai/v1/tasks/runs" \
  -H "x-api-key: $PARALLEL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": "...", "processor": "ultra", "enable_events": true}'

# Then connect to the event stream
curl "https://api.parallel.ai/v1/tasks/runs/{run_id}/events" \
  -H "x-api-key: $PARALLEL_API_KEY"
```

**Key points:**

- See real-time progress: research plan, sources being explored, intermediate findings
- The final `task_run.state` event includes the complete output
- Ideal for showing users what’s happening during long research tasks
- See [Streaming Events documentation](/task-api/task-sse) for event types and examples

### [​](#which-should-i-use) Which Should I Use?

| Scenario | Recommended Method |
| --- | --- |
| Testing or one-off scripts | Polling |
| Backend service processing many tasks | Webhooks |
| User-facing app showing research progress | SSE |
| Simple integration without a server | Polling |
| Production system needing reliability | Webhooks + Polling fallback |

## [​](#example-chatting-with-deep-research) Example: Chatting with Deep Research

You can use [interactions](/task-api/guides/interactions) to ask follow-up questions about a Deep Research result. The initial research runs with a `pro` or `ultra` processor, and each follow-up automatically has the full context of the original report — so you can drill into specific findings without re-running the entire research.
