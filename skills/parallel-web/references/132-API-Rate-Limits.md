The following table shows the default rate limits for each Parallel API product:
| Product | Default Quota | What Counts as a Request |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Search | 600 per min | Each POST to `/v1/search` |
| Extract | 600 per min | Each POST to `/v1/extract` |
| Tasks/TaskGroups | 2,000 per min | Each POST to `/v1/tasks/runs` or `/v1/tasks/groups/{taskgroup\_id}/runs` (creating tasks) |
| Chat | 300 per min | Each POST to `/v1beta/chat/completions` |
| FindAll | 300 per hour | Each POST to `/v1beta/findall/runs` (creating a generator) |
| Entity Search | 600 per min | Each POST to `/v1beta/findall/entity-search` |
| Monitor | 300 per min | Each POST to `/v1alpha/monitors` |
\*\*Rate limits apply to POST requests that create new resources.\*\* GET requests
(retrieving results, checking status) do not count against these limits. For
example, polling a task's status with `GET /v1/tasks/runs/{run\_id}` does not
consume your Tasks rate limit—only creating new tasks does.
## Pricing
Rate limits are separate from pricing. For cost information, see [Pricing](/getting-started/pricing).
## Need higher limits?
If you need to expand your rate limits, please contact \*\*[support@parallel.ai](mailto:support@parallel.ai)\*\* with your use case and requirements.
