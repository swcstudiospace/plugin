# Extract API Quickstart
> Convert any public URL into clean, LLM-optimized markdown with the Parallel Extract API

For AI agents: a documentation index is available at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt). The full text of all docs is at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt). You may also fetch any page as Markdown by appending `.md` to its URL or sending `Accept: text/markdown`.

The \*\*Extract API\*\* converts any public URL into clean markdown, including
JavaScript-heavy pages and PDFs. It returns focused excerpts aligned to your objective,
or full page content if requested.
See [Pricing](/getting-started/pricing) for a detailed schedule of rates.
## 1. Set Up Prerequisites
Generate your API key on [Platform](https://platform.parallel.ai). Then, set up with the TypeScript SDK, Python SDK or with cURL:
```bash cURL theme={"system"}
echo "Install curl and jq via brew, apt, or your favorite package manager"
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"
```
```bash Python theme={"system"}
pip install parallel-web
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"
```
```bash TypeScript theme={"system"}
npm install parallel-web
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"
```
## 2. Execute Your First Extract
Extract clean markdown content from specific URLs. This example retrieves content from
the UN's history page with excerpts focused on the founding:
```bash cURL theme={"system"}
curl https://api.parallel.ai/v1/extract \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "x-api-key: $PARALLEL\_API\_KEY" \
-d '{
"urls": ["https://www.un.org/en/about-us/history-of-the-un"],
"objective": "When was the United Nations established?"
}'
```
```python Python theme={"system"}
import os
from parallel import Parallel
client = Parallel(api\_key=os.environ["PARALLEL\_API\_KEY"])
extract = client.extract(
urls=["https://www.un.org/en/about-us/history-of-the-un"],
objective="When was the United Nations established?",
)
for result in extract.results:
print(f"{result.title}: {result.url}")
for excerpt in result.excerpts:
print(excerpt[:200])
```
```typescript TypeScript theme={"system"}
import Parallel from "parallel-web";
const client = new Parallel({ apiKey: process.env.PARALLEL\_API\_KEY });
const extract = await client.extract({
urls: ["https://www.un.org/en/about-us/history-of-the-un"],
objective: "When was the United Nations established?",
});
for (const result of extract.results) {
console.log(`${result.title}: ${result.url}`);
for (const excerpt of result.excerpts) {
console.log(excerpt.slice(0, 200));
}
}
```
## Response Structure
Each result in the `results` array contains:
| Field | Type | Description |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url` | string | The URL that was extracted. |
| `title` | string? | Page title, if available. |
| `publish\_date` | string? | Publish date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, if available. |
| `excerpts` | string\[] | Relevant excerpts formatted as markdown. |
| `full\_content` | string? | Full page content formatted as markdown, if `full\_content` was enabled. |
Both `excerpts` and `full\_content` return content formatted as markdown. This includes links as `[text](url)`, headings, lists, and other markup. If you need plain text, strip the markdown formatting in your application.

Representatives of 50 countries gathered at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, California from 25 April to 26 June 1945.
