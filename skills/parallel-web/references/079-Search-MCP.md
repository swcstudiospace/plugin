# Search MCP
> Add real-time web search and content extraction to AI agents with the Parallel Search MCP Server

For AI agents: a documentation index is available at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt). The full text of all docs is at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt). You may also fetch any page as Markdown by appending `.md` to its URL or sending `Accept: text/markdown`.

The Parallel Search MCP Server provides drop-in web search and content extraction capabilities for any MCP-aware model. The tools invoke the [Search API](/search/search-quickstart) and [Extract API](/extract/extract-quickstart) endpoints but present a simpler interface to ensure effective use by agents. Search runs in [`basic` mode](/search/modes) — tuned for low-latency responses inside agent loops — and total excerpts per tool call are capped to roughly 25,000 characters to stay within typical MCP client output limits.
\*\*The Search MCP is free to use\*\* — no API key required, great for exploration and light use. For production use cases or higher rate limits, [create a Parallel account](https://platform.parallel.ai) and pass your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
The Search MCP comprises two tools:
\* \*\*`web\_search`\*\* — General-purpose web search inside an agent's reasoning loop. Use when the agent needs current information or diverse sources across multiple angles.
\* \*\*`web\_fetch`\*\* — Pulls token-efficient markdown from specific URLs. Use after `web\_search` narrows down candidates, or when the agent already has a URL it needs to read in depth.
## One-Click Install
Install in any of the following clients with a single click — no API key required.

One-click install for Cursor.

One-click install for VS Code.

One-click install for LM Studio.

One-click install for Goose.
For Claude Code, Codex CLI, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Zed, Gemini CLI, Warp, Kiro, and other clients, see the [Installation](#installation) section below — those clients use a CLI command or a JSON config file rather than deep-link URLs.
## Use Cases
The Search MCP is suited for any application where real-world information is needed as part of an AI agent's reasoning loop. Common use cases include:
\* Real-time fact checking and verification during conversations
\* Gathering current information to answer user questions
\* Researching topics that require recent or live data
\* Retrieving content from specific URLs to analyze or summarize
\* Competitive intelligence and market research
## Installation
The Search MCP can be installed in any MCP client. Two endpoints are available:
\* \*\*`https://search.parallel.ai/mcp`\*\* — default. Free to use anonymously at lower rate limits. Pass a Parallel API key as a Bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer `) to unlock higher limits. \*\*OAuth is not advertised on this endpoint\*\*, so clients that support OAuth sign-in (Claude Desktop, Claude.ai custom connectors, Codex, etc.) will not prompt you to log in here — use `/mcp-oauth` below if you prefer OAuth.
\* \*\*`https://search.parallel.ai/mcp-oauth`\*\* — the OAuth-capable endpoint. Requires authentication: Bearer API key OR the OAuth flow. Anonymous requests return `401`. Use this when you want OAuth instead of managing a Bearer key, or when you need to guarantee every request is attributed to a Parallel account — for example, organization-wide deployments, Zero Data Retention (ZDR) setups, or any context where unauthenticated traffic is not acceptable.
Swap `/mcp` for `/mcp-oauth` in any of the config snippets below if you want OAuth or enforced authentication. The Search MCP can also be [used programmatically](/integrations/mcp/programmatic-use) by providing your Parallel API key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
### Cursor
Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or `.cursor/mcp.json` (project-specific):
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
For more details, see the [Cursor MCP documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp).
\*\*\*
### VS Code
Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace (or run the \*\*MCP: Open User Configuration\*\* command for a user-level `mcp.json`):
```json theme={"system"}
{
"servers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"type": "http",
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
For more details, see the [VS Code MCP documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers).
\*\*\*
### Claude Desktop / Claude.ai
Go to Settings → Connectors → Add Custom Connector, and fill in:
```text theme={"system"}
Name: Parallel Search MCP
URL: https://search.parallel.ai/mcp
```
This URL connects anonymously. If you'd rather sign in with OAuth (so Claude manages the token for you), use `https://search.parallel.ai/mcp-oauth` instead — it triggers Claude's OAuth sign-in flow.
If you are part of an organization, you may not have access to custom connectors. Contact your organization administrator for assistance.
\*\*Org admins (Team / Enterprise plans):\*\* to route Claude's web queries through the Parallel Search MCP instead of Claude's built-in web search, disable the native web search tool at [\*\*Admin settings → Capabilities\*\*](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/capabilities). Once off at the workspace level, members cannot re-enable it individually. See the [Claude web search docs](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10684626-enabling-and-using-web-search).
For the org-wide deployment, also point the connector at the [`/mcp-oauth` endpoint](#installation) (not `/mcp`) so every request requires a Parallel API key or OAuth — useful when you need every call attributed to the organization.
If you are not an admin, go to Settings → Developer → Edit Config and use the following JSON. If your config already has an `mcpServers` object, add the `Parallel Search MCP` entry inside it without replacing your other servers.
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"command": "npx",
"args": [
"-y",
"mcp-remote",
"https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
]
}
}
}
```
No API key is required for the Search MCP. To unlock higher rate limits, grab a key from [Platform](https://platform.parallel.ai) and append `"--header", "authorization: Bearer YOUR-PARALLEL-API-KEY"` to the `args` array.
For more details, see the [Claude remote MCP documentation](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11175166-getting-started-with-custom-connectors-using-remote-mcp).
\*\*\*
### Claude Code
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash theme={"system"}
claude mcp add --transport http "Parallel-Search-MCP" https://search.parallel.ai/mcp
```
In Claude code, use the command:
```
/mcp
```
Then follow the steps in your browser to login.
For more details, see the [Claude Code MCP documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp#authenticate-with-remote-mcp-servers).
\*\*\*
### Codex CLI
Run one of the following, depending on how you want to authenticate:
```bash Free, anonymous theme={"system"}
codex mcp add parallel-search --url https://search.parallel.ai/mcp
```
```bash Higher rate limits via API key theme={"system"}
# set PARALLEL\_API\_KEY in your environment first (key from platform.parallel.ai)
codex mcp add parallel-search --url https://search.parallel.ai/mcp \
--bearer-token-env-var PARALLEL\_API\_KEY
```
```bash Higher rate limits via OAuth theme={"system"}
codex mcp add parallel-search --url https://search.parallel.ai/mcp-oauth
# complete the browser authorization when prompted
```
Each command writes the equivalent `[mcp\_servers.parallel-search]` entry to `~/.codex/config.toml` — you can also hand-edit it if you prefer.
Restart Codex after adding the server. For more details, see the [Codex MCP documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp/).
\*\*\*
### Other Clients

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp\_config.json`:

```
For more details, see the [Gemini CLI MCP documentation](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/).

\*\*Warning:\*\* [Developer Mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode) must be enabled, and this feature may not be available to everyone. MCPs in ChatGPT are experimental and may not work reliably.
First, go to Settings → Connectors → Advanced Settings, and turn on Developer Mode.
Then, in connector settings, click Create and fill in:
```text theme={"system"}
Name: Parallel Search MCP
URL: https://search.parallel.ai/mcp
Authentication: OAuth
```
In a new chat, ensure Developer Mode is turned on with the connector(s) selected.
For more details, see the [ChatGPT Developer Mode documentation](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-apps-and-full-mcp-connectors-in-chatgpt-beta).

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash theme={"system"}
amp mcp add "Parallel-Search-MCP" https://search.parallel.ai/mcp
```
The OAuth flow will start when you start Amp.
For more details, see the [Amp MCP documentation](https://ampcode.com/manual#mcp-oauth).

Add to `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (workspace) or `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (global):
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
For more details, see the [Kiro MCP documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/mcp/configuration/).

In the Antigravity Agent pane, click the menu (⋮) → MCP Servers → Manage MCP Servers → View raw config, then add:
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel-Search-MCP": {
"serverUrl": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
For higher rate limits, add a `headers` block with `"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR\_API\_KEY"` and your key from [platform.parallel.ai](https://platform.parallel.ai).
For more details, see the [Antigravity MCP documentation](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp).

Add to `opencode.json` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (global):
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcp": {
"parallel-search": {
"type": "remote",
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp",
"enabled": true
}
}
}
```
For more details, see the [OpenCode MCP documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/mcp-servers/).

Add to `.roo/mcp.json` in your workspace (or edit the global `mcp\_settings.json` from the Roo Code MCP settings view):
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"type": "streamable-http",
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
Project config takes precedence over global. For more details, see the [Roo Code MCP documentation](https://docs.roocode.com/features/mcp/using-mcp-in-roo).

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash theme={"system"}
openhands mcp add parallel-search --transport http https://search.parallel.ai/mcp
```
Or add manually to `~/.openhands/mcp.json`:
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
Inside an OpenHands conversation, use `/mcp` to verify the server is active. For more details, see the [OpenHands MCP documentation](https://docs.openhands.dev/openhands/usage/cli/mcp-servers).

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash theme={"system"}
droid mcp add parallel-search https://search.parallel.ai/mcp --type http
```
Inside droid, type `/mcp` to open the interactive manager and verify the server is connected. For more details, see the [Factory MCP documentation](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/mcp).

Pi ships without built-in MCP support, so install the [`pi-mcp-adapter`](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter) package first:
```bash theme={"system"}
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
```
Restart Pi, then add the Search MCP to `.mcp.json` in your project (or `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json` for a user-global config):
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"parallel-search": {
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp",
"directTools": true
}
}
}
```
`directTools: true` registers `web\_search` and `web\_fetch` alongside Pi's built-in tools instead of hiding them behind the adapter's `mcp` proxy. Run `/mcp` inside Pi to verify the server is detected. For more details, see the [pi-mcp-adapter README](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter).
Alternatively, skip MCP entirely and use the [Parallel CLI](/integrations/cli) as a Pi skill — that's the same pattern as our [ClawHub / OpenClaw](/integrations/clawhub) integration.

OpenClaw stores MCP server definitions in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `mcp.servers`. Save the Search MCP via the `openclaw mcp set` CLI:
```bash theme={"system"}
openclaw mcp set parallel-search '{"url":"https://search.parallel.ai/mcp","transport":"streamable-http"}'
```
Or edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` directly:
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcp": {
"servers": {
"parallel-search": {
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp",
"transport": "streamable-http"
}
}
}
}
```
The `transport` field is required — OpenClaw defaults to SSE when it's omitted, but the Search MCP uses Streamable HTTP. No API key is required; for higher rate limits, add an optional `headers` map with `"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR-PARALLEL-API-KEY"` (key from [platform.parallel.ai](https://platform.parallel.ai)).
`openclaw mcp set` only writes to config — it doesn't connect to the server or reload running agents. Start a new OpenClaw agent session (or restart your current one) for the tools to show up. Verify the saved definition with `openclaw mcp list` / `openclaw mcp show parallel-search`. For the full MCP CLI reference, see the [OpenClaw MCP docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/mcp).
You can also skip MCP entirely and use the [Parallel CLI](/integrations/cli) as an OpenClaw skill — see the [ClawHub integration](/integrations/clawhub).

Add to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:
```yaml theme={"system"}
mcp\_servers:
parallel\_search:
url: "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
```
For more details, see the [Hermes Agent MCP documentation](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/mcp).

Add a file at `.continue/mcpServers/parallel-search.yaml` in your workspace:
```yaml theme={"system"}
name: Parallel Search MCP
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1
mcpServers:
- name: Parallel Search MCP
type: streamable-http
url: https://search.parallel.ai/mcp
```
For more details, see the [Continue.dev MCP documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/mcp).

These clients currently support only stdio-transport MCP servers — they can't connect directly to remote HTTP endpoints. Wrap the Search MCP with [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) to proxy it through a local stdio process:
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"command": "npx",
"args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"]
}
}
}
```
Add an `--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-PARALLEL-API-KEY"` argument if you're hitting `/mcp-oauth` or want higher rate limits.
Placement differs per client — see the [Zed MCP docs](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/mcp), [Warp MCP docs](https://docs.warp.dev/university/how-warp-uses-warp/using-mcp-servers-with-warp), or [Raycast MCP docs](https://manual.raycast.com/ai/model-context-protocol) for the exact file location and wrapper format.
If your client isn't listed, most MCP clients accept the `mcpServers` format shown in the Cursor section. For clients that use a different wrapper (e.g., VS Code's `mcp.servers`, Windsurf's `serverUrl`), check the client's documentation for the correct field names.
## Best practices
### Filtering by date or domain
To filter search results by date or domain, include these constraints directly in your search query or objective rather than expecting separate parameters. For example:
\* "Latest AI research papers from 2026"
\* "News about climate change from nytimes.com"
\* "Product announcements from apple.com in the last month"
If date or domain filtering is important for your task, prompt the agent explicitly to include these details when using the tool.
We have experimented with adding dedicated date and domain parameters to the Search MCP tools, but found they harm quality overall—LLMs tend to overuse them, which overconstrains search results.
## Troubleshooting
### Common Installation Issues
This error occurs when Cline attempts OAuth authentication but the redirect URI isn't using HTTPS. The Search MCP at `/mcp` is free and doesn't require OAuth in the first place — wrap it in `mcp-remote` so Cline treats it as a plain stdio server:
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"command": "npx",
"args": [
"-y",
"mcp-remote",
"https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
]
}
}
}
```
If you want higher rate limits (or you're specifically targeting `/mcp-oauth`), append `"--header", "authorization: Bearer YOUR-PARALLEL-API-KEY"` to the `args` array with a key from [platform.parallel.ai](https://platform.parallel.ai).

Gemini CLI uses HTTP MCPs and can authenticate via OAuth. The Search MCP at `/mcp` doesn't require an API key or OAuth, so the simplest setup has no auth at all:
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"httpUrl": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
Add this to `~/.gemini/settings.json`. If you want higher rate limits (or to target `/mcp-oauth`), swap in the `mcp-remote` wrapper and pass a key from [platform.parallel.ai](https://platform.parallel.ai) as a Bearer header:
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"command": "npx",
"args": [
"-y",
"mcp-remote",
"https://search.parallel.ai/mcp",
"--header",
"authorization: Bearer YOUR-PARALLEL-API-KEY"
]
}
}
}
```

VS Code's `mcp.json` uses a different structure than Cursor's `mcp.json`. Common mistake: copying a Cursor-style config into VS Code.
\*\*Incorrect (Cursor format):\*\*
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"parallel-search": {
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
\*\*Correct (VS Code format, `.vscode/mcp.json` or user-level `mcp.json`):\*\*
```json theme={"system"}
{
"servers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"type": "http",
"url": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
Note: VS Code uses a top-level `servers` object (not `mcpServers`) and includes `type: "http"` for remote HTTP servers.

Windsurf uses a different configuration format than Cursor.
\*\*Correct Windsurf configuration:\*\*
```json theme={"system"}
{
"mcpServers": {
"Parallel Search MCP": {
"serverUrl": "https://search.parallel.ai/mcp"
}
}
}
```
Note: Windsurf uses `serverUrl` instead of `url`. Add this to your Windsurf MCP configuration file.

If you're getting connection errors:
1. \*\*Check your network:\*\* Ensure you can reach `https://search.parallel.ai`
2. \*\*Verify API key:\*\* Make sure your key is valid at [platform.parallel.ai](https://platform.parallel.ai)
3. \*\*Check balance:\*\* A 402 error means insufficient credits—add funds to your account
4. \*\*Restart your IDE:\*\* Some clients cache MCP connections

If the MCP installs but tools don't show up:
1. \*\*Restart your IDE\*\* completely (not just reload)
2. \*\*Check configuration syntax:\*\* Ensure valid JSON with no trailing commas
3. \*\*Verify the server URL:\*\* Must be exactly `https://search.parallel.ai/mcp`
4. \*\*Check IDE logs:\*\* Look for MCP-related errors in your IDE's output/debug panel
