Parallel's APIs are available through the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zpw7j3ozjqlb4).
You can use your AWS account to access all of Parallel's features.
Signing up through AWS allows you to provision resources based on your requirements and pay through your existing AWS billing.
## How to Sign Up Through AWS Marketplace
1. Navigate to [AWS Marketplace](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search) and search for
Parallel Web Systems, or go directly to our [product listing](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zpw7j3ozjqlb4).
2. Click on the product listing, then select `View purchase`.
3. Subscribe to our listing. You can review pricing for different processors
[here](/task-api/guides/choose-a-processor).
4. Click `Set up your account`. You will need to create a new organization linked to your AWS account,
even if you're already part of other organizations. See our
[FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions) for more details.
5. After creating your new organization, you can use our products as usual through our API or
platform interface.
Your usage charges will appear in the AWS Billing & Cloud Management dashboard with your other AWS services.
## Frequently Asked Questions

To use AWS Marketplace billing in the future, you would need to create a new
Parallel account through the Marketplace.

Yes. Parallel delivers identical platform capabilities to all customers—whether you sign up directly or through AWS Marketplace.
The difference is in billing and commercial arrangements, not technical functionality.

AWS account creation typically fails for two reasons:
i. Your AWS account is already linked to a Parallel account.
ii. Your signup token expired due to a delay between subscribing on AWS Marketplace and completing account setup.
You'll see a specific error message indicating which issue you're experiencing.
For expired tokens, try canceling and recreating your subscription. If problems persist,
[contact support](mailto:support@parallel.ai). For existing account conflicts, check with your organization about
joining their existing Parallel account.

For AWS, usages are aggregated hourly and sent to AWS for metering. For a more granular usage report, you
can use the Usage tab in the settings page in our platform.
