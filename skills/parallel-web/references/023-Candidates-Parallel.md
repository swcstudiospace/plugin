# Candidates - Parallel

Source: https://docs.parallel.ai/findall-api/core-concepts/findall-candidates

## [​](#overview) Overview

A **candidate** is an entity that FindAll discovers during the generation phase of a run. Each candidate represents a potential match that is evaluated against your match conditions.

### [​](#candidate-states) Candidate States

Candidates progress through these states during evaluation:

- **Generated**: Discovered from web data, queued for evaluation
- **Matched**: Successfully satisfied all match conditions
- **Unmatched**: Failed to satisfy one or more match conditions
- **Discarded**: Removed from further evaluation because the candidate was invalid, irrelevant, or duplicated

**Post-Match Events**: When using [Streaming Events](/findall-api/features/findall-sse) or [Webhooks](/findall-api/features/findall-webhook), you may receive **`enriched`** events for matched candidates. These are event types (not `match_status` values) that indicate when additional data has been extracted via enrichments after a candidate has already matched.

## [​](#candidate-object-structure) Candidate Object Structure

Candidates in FindAll results, SSE events, and webhook payloads use this model. Webhook payloads also include `findall_id`. Optional fields are omitted when they are not available.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate_id` | string | Unique identifier for the candidate |
| `name` | string | Name of the entity |
| `url` | string | Primary URL for the entity |
| `description` | string, optional | Brief description of the entity, when available |
| `match_status` | enum | One of `generated`, `matched`, `unmatched`, and `discarded` |
| `output` | object, optional | Key-value pairs showing evaluation results for each match condition and enrichment; omitted before evaluation (see section below for more details) |
| `basis` | array[FieldBasis], optional | Citations, reasoning, and confidence scores for evaluated fields. See [FieldBasis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis#the-fieldbasis-object) for more details. |

### [​](#understanding-the-output-field) Understanding the `output` Field

The `output` field contains evaluation results where each key corresponds to a field name. Match conditions include an `is_matched` boolean, while enrichments do not:

```
{
  "founded_after_2020_check": {
    "value": "2021",
    "type": "match_condition",
    "is_matched": true
  },
  "ceo_name": {
    "value": "Ramin Hasani",
    "type": "enrichment"
  }
}
```

### [​](#understanding-the-basis-field) Understanding the `basis` Field

The `basis` field provides citations, reasoning, and confidence scores for each field in `output`.

**For complete details on basis structure and usage**, see [Access Research Basis](/task-api/guides/access-research-basis).

## [​](#excluding-candidates) Excluding Candidates

**Use case**: Excluding candidates is useful when you already know certain entities match your criteria (such as results from previous runs or entities you’ve already identified), allowing you to focus the run on discovering new matches.

FindAll uses intelligence to deduplicate and disambiguate candidates you provide in the exclude list, which handles aliases and entities with slightly different names or URL variations. However, using the most official and disambiguated name and URL is recommended for best results.

Provide an `exclude_list` with up to 10,000 entries to prevent specific entities from being generated or evaluated. Excluded entities do not appear in results or events.
**Exclude list structure:** Array of objects with `name` (string) and `url` (string) fields.

## [​](#retrieving-candidates) Retrieving Candidates

Candidates can be accessed through multiple methods:

- **[`/result` endpoint](/findall-api/findall-quickstart#step-4-get-results)**: Retrieve the current candidate snapshot while a run is active or after it stops. Active snapshots can also include `generated` candidates.
- **[Streaming Events](/findall-api/features/findall-sse)**: Stream candidates in real-time as they’re generated and evaluated
- **[Webhooks](/findall-api/features/findall-webhook)**: Receive HTTP callbacks for the candidate event types emitted by the webhook runtime
