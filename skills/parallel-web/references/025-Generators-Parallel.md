# Generators - Parallel

Source: https://docs.parallel.ai/findall-api/core-concepts/findall-generator-pricing

FindAll offers different generators that determine the quality and thoroughness of FindAll run results. See [Pricing](/getting-started/pricing) for generator costs and all API rates.

## [​](#generators) Generators

| Generator | Best For | Candidate Pool | Expected Match Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `preview` | Testing queries before committing to a full run | 5–10 candidates evaluated | Varies — use to validate schema |
| `base` | Broad, common queries where you expect many matches | Moderate pool | Higher (broad criteria match more candidates) |
| `core` | Specific queries with moderate expected matches | Large pool | Moderate (balanced breadth and depth) |
| `pro` | Highly specific queries with rare or hard-to-find matches | Largest pool | Lower per candidate (thorough search for rare matches) |

**Candidate pool size matters**: Each generator evaluates a different number of candidates. `preview` evaluates the requested 5–10 candidates, while `pro` searches the most thoroughly. If you’re getting 0 matches, try upgrading to a stronger generator before modifying your query — the issue may be pool size, not query quality.

## [​](#how-to-choose) How to Choose

### [​](#1-start-with-preview) 1. Start with Preview

Always test your query with `preview` first to validate your approach and get a sense of how many matches to expect. See [Preview](/findall-api/features/findall-preview).

### [​](#2-choosing-the-right-generator) 2. Choosing the Right Generator

Based on your preview results and query characteristics:
**Choose `base` when:**

- You expect many matches (e.g., “companies in healthcare”)
- Your query has broad criteria that are common
- You’re searching for fewer than 20 matches where the low fixed cost matters most

**Choose `core` when:**

- You expect a moderate number of matches (e.g., “healthcare companies using AI for diagnostics”)
- Your query is fairly specific but not extremely rare
- You need between 20-50 matches

**Choose `pro` when:**

- You expect few matches or very specific criteria (e.g., “Series A healthcare AI companies with FDA-approved products”)
- Your query requires the most thorough and comprehensive search
- The higher per-match cost is acceptable for your use case

**Note:** For match counts above 50, the per-match cost becomes more significant than the fixed cost in your total bill. When using enrichments, consider that enrichment costs also scale with the number of matches.

## [​](#enrichments) Enrichments

When adding [enrichments](/findall-api/features/findall-enrich) to extract additional data from your matches, each enrichment adds its own per-match cost based on the [Task API processor](/task-api/guides/choose-a-processor) you choose. Since enrichments run on every match and you can add multiple enrichments, they can significantly impact your total costs for high-match queries. Choose enrichment processors based on the complexity of data extraction needed.

## [​](#additional-notes) Additional Notes

- **[Extend Runs](/findall-api/features/findall-extend)**: Fixed cost is not charged again, only per-match costs for new matches. If enrichments are present, they also run on new matches at the same enrichment processor cost.
- **[Enrichments](/findall-api/features/findall-enrich)**: Enrichments are charged based on Task API processor pricing × number of matches. You can add multiple enrichments using different processors, and each enrichment’s cost is calculated separately.
- **[Run Lifecycle](/findall-api/core-concepts/findall-lifecycle)**: You’re charged for work completed before cancellation, including any enrichments that finished.

**Tip:** If a run terminates early, consider using a more advanced generator (like `pro` instead of `base`) or refining your query criteria to be more achievable.
