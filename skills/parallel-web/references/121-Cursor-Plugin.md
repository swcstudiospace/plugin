For AI agents: a documentation index is available at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt). The full text of all docs is at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt).

Give Cursor an advanced suite of web search tools for harder tasks that standard search struggles with — available as slash commands and automatic skills directly inside Cursor.
Parallel is available in the [Cursor Plugin Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace/parallel). View the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/parallel-web/parallel-cursor-plugin).
## Features
| Capability | Skill | Command |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| \*\*Web Search\*\* | `parallel-web-search` | `/parallel-search ` |
| \*\*Content Extraction\*\* | `parallel-web-extract` | `/parallel-extract ` |
| \*\*Deep Research\*\* | `parallel-deep-research` | `/parallel-research ` |
| \*\*Data Enrichment\*\* | `parallel-data-enrichment` | `/parallel-enrich ` |
Additional commands: `/parallel-setup`, `/parallel-status `, `/parallel-result `
## Prerequisites

Install the [Parallel CLI](/integrations/cli) via `pipx`:
```bash theme={"system"}
pipx install "parallel-web-tools[cli]" && pipx ensurepath
```
See the [CLI docs](/integrations/cli) for `uv`, Homebrew, npm, and other installation methods.

```bash theme={"system"}
parallel-cli login
# or
export PARALLEL\_API\_KEY="your\_api\_key"
```
See the [CLI docs](/integrations/cli#authentication) for other authentication methods.
## Installation
Install the plugin from the [Cursor Plugin Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace/parallel), or run in Cursor's chat:
```
/add-plugin parallel
```
Then run the setup command to verify the CLI is installed and authenticated:
```
/parallel-setup
```
### Manual CLI Setup
If you prefer to set up the CLI manually:
```bash theme={"system"}
pipx install "parallel-web-tools[cli]" && pipx ensurepath
parallel-cli login
```
See the [CLI docs](/integrations/cli) for `uv`, Homebrew, npm, and other installation methods.
## Quick Start
\*\*Search the web:\*\*
```
/parallel-search latest developments in AI chip manufacturing
```
\*\*Extract a webpage:\*\*
```
/parallel-extract https://example.com/article
```
\*\*Deep research (slower, more thorough):\*\*
```
/parallel-research comprehensive analysis of React vs Vue in 2026
```
\*\*Enrich data:\*\*
```
/parallel-enrich companies.csv with CEO name, funding amount, and headquarters
```
## Usage
Beyond slash commands, the plugin also installs skills that Cursor uses automatically based on context:
\* Ask a question that needs current information and Cursor will search the web
\* Paste a URL and ask Cursor to read it — it will extract the content
\* Ask for exhaustive research on a topic and Cursor will run a deep research task
\* Give Cursor a list of companies and ask it to find their CEOs — it will use data enrichment
