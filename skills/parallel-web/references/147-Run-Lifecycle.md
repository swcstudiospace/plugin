## Run Statuses and Termination Reasons
FindAll runs normally progress from `queued` → `running` → a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`). The response schema also defines `cancelling` and `action\_required` for compatibility with the shared run-status contract.
A run is \*\*active\*\* when `status.is\_active` is `true`. The shared status schema treats `queued`, `running`, and `cancelling` as active, although current FindAll cancellation moves directly from an active state to `cancelled`.
### Status Definitions
| Status | `is\_active` | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queued` | `true` | Run is waiting to start processing |
| `running` | `true` | Run is actively generating, evaluating, or enriching candidates |
| `cancelling` | `true` | Shared transitional status; current FindAll runs do not emit it |
| `action\_required` | `false` | Run is halted because its state requires attention |
| `completed` | `false` | Run finished; inspect `termination\_reason` for why |
| `failed` | `false` | Run failed or timed out |
| `cancelled` | `false` | Run was cancelled by the user |
You can extend a non-preview run while it is queued or running. A completed run can be extended only when its `termination\_reason` is `match\_limit\_met`. Enrichments can be added after creation; adding one to any terminal run requeues that run while the enrichment is processed. Cancellation applies to active runs.
### Termination Reasons
When a run reaches a terminal state, it will have one of these termination reasons:
| Termination Reason | Description | Can Extend? |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `match\_limit\_met` | Successfully found the requested number of matches | ✅ Yes |
| `low\_match\_rate` | Match rate too low to continue efficiently | ❌ No - try a more powerful generator |
| `candidates\_exhausted` | All available candidates have been processed | ❌ No - broaden query |
| `error\_occurred` | Run encountered an error and cannot be continued | ❌ No |
| `timeout` | Run timed out and cannot be continued | ❌ No |
| `user\_cancelled` | Run was cancelled by the user | ❌ No |
| `insufficient\_funds` | Account balance was exhausted before more work could be scheduled | ❌ No — add funds and create a new run |
