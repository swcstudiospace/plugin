# FindAll API Quickstart - Parallel

Source: https://docs.parallel.ai/findall-api/findall-quickstart

**Beta Notice**: Parallel FindAll is currently in public beta. Endpoints and request/response formats are subject to change. We will provide 30 days notice before any breaking changes.

## [​](#what-is-findall) What is FindAll?

FindAll is a web-scale entity discovery system that turns natural language queries into structured, enriched databases of companies, people, and other real-world entities. It answers questions like “FindAll AI companies that raised Series A funding in the last 3 months” by combining intelligent search, evaluation, and enrichment capabilities.
Unlike traditional search APIs that return a fixed set of results, FindAll generates candidates from web data, validates them against your criteria, and optionally enriches matches with additional structured information—all from a single natural language query.

**Need results in seconds?** [Entity Search](/findall-api/entity-search) is FindAll’s fast, synchronous counterpart for people-and-company search, optimized for recall and speed where FindAll is optimized for precision. It returns a set of matching results in seconds, without FindAll’s verification, enrichment, or citations. Use it when latency matters more than precision.

## [​](#key-features-&-use-cases) Key Features & Use Cases

FindAll excels at entity discovery and research tasks that require both breadth and depth:

- **Natural Language Input**: Express complex search criteria in plain English
- **Intelligent Entity Discovery**: Automatically generates and validates potential matches
- **Structured Enrichment**: Extract specific attributes for each discovered entity
- **Citation-backed Results**: Evaluated fields can include reasoning and source citations through `basis`
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle large-scale searches without blocking your application

## [​](#pricing) Pricing

See [Pricing](/getting-started/pricing) for a detailed schedule of rates.

### [​](#common-use-cases) Common Use Cases

- **Market Mapping**: “FindAll fintech companies offering earned-wage access in Brazil.”
- **Competitive Intelligence**: “FindAll AI infrastructure providers that raised Series B funding in the last 6 months.”
- **Lead Generation**: “FindAll residential roofing companies in Charlotte, NC.”
- **People Search & Recruiting**: “FindAll engineering leaders at Series B fintech companies headquartered in Berlin.”
- **Financial Research**: “FindAll S&P 500 stocks that dropped X% in last 30 days and listed tariffs as a key risk.”

### [​](#what-happens-during-a-run) What Happens During a Run

When you create a FindAll run, the system executes three key stages:

1. **Generate Candidates from Web Data**: FindAll searches across the web to identify potential entities that might match your query. Each candidate enters the `generated` status.
2. **Evaluate Candidates Based on Match Conditions**: Each generated candidate is evaluated against your match conditions. Candidates that satisfy all conditions reach `matched` status; those that do not become `unmatched`. The result snapshot can include both groups, so filter on `match_status` when you need only successful matches.
3. **Extract Enrichments for Matched Candidates**: After you add an enrichment through `/enrich`, FindAll uses the Task API to extract those fields for matched candidates and handles the orchestration automatically.

This three-stage approach ensures efficiency: you only pay to enrich candidates that actually match your criteria.

## [​](#quick-example) Quick Example

Here’s a complete example that finds portfolio companies. The workflow consists of four steps: converting natural language to a schema, starting the run, polling for completion, and retrieving results.

### [​](#the-basic-workflow) The Basic Workflow

The FindAll API follows a simple four-step workflow:

1. **Ingest**: Convert your natural language query into a structured schema
2. **Run**: Start the findall run to discover and match candidates
3. **Poll**: Check status until the run reaches a terminal state
4. **Fetch**: Retrieve the current candidate snapshot and any available reasoning and citations

```
Natural Language Query → Structured Schema → findall_id → Candidate Snapshot
```

### [​](#step-1-ingest) Step 1: Ingest

**Purpose**: Converts your natural language query into a structured schema with `entity_type` and `match_conditions`.
The ingest endpoint automatically extracts:

- What type of entities to search for (companies, people, products, etc.)
- Match conditions that must be satisfied
- Optional enrichment suggestions

)
```

const client = new Parallel({
  apiKey: process.env.PARALLEL_API_KEY
});

const run = await client.beta.findall.ingest({
  objective: "FindAll portfolio companies of Khosla Ventures founded after 2020"
});
```

**Response:**

```
{
  "objective": "FindAll portfolio companies of Khosla Ventures founded after 2020",
  "entity_type": "companies",
  "match_conditions": [
    {
      "name": "khosla_ventures_portfolio_check",
      "description": "Company must be a portfolio company of Khosla Ventures."
    },
    {
      "name": "founded_after_2020_check",
      "description": "Company must have been founded after 2020."
    }
  ],
  "generator": "core"
}
```

### [​](#customizing-the-ingest-schema) Customizing the ingest schema

The ingest endpoint generates a suggested schema, but you can (and should) review and modify it before creating a run. Common modifications include:

- **Relaxing temporal conditions**: Ingest may interpret phrases like “founded after 2023” strictly (e.g., “within the last 1 year”). You can broaden the description to be more inclusive.
- **Adjusting match condition descriptions**: Make descriptions more or less specific to control match rates.
- **Adding or removing match conditions**: Tailor the schema to your exact needs.
- **Changing the entity type**: Correct the entity type if ingest misidentified it.

For example, if ingest generated a strict condition like `"Company must have been founded within the last 1 year"`, you might change it to `"Company must have been founded in 2025 or later"` for more reliable matching.

The ingest schema is a starting point, not a final answer. Editing `match_conditions` between the ingest and create steps is the recommended way to refine your query for better results.

### [​](#step-2-create-findall-run) Step 2: Create FindAll Run

**Purpose**: Starts the asynchronous findall process to generate and evaluate candidates.
You can use the schema from ingest directly, or modify it before passing it to the create endpoint. Key parameters:

- `generator`: Choose `preview`, `base`, `core`, or `pro` based on your needs (see [Generators and Pricing](/findall-api/core-concepts/findall-generator-pricing))
- `match_limit`: For `base`, `core`, and `pro`, the maximum number of matches to find. For `preview`, the number of candidates to evaluate (5–10).

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

Run completed with 0 matched candidates

This typically happens when match conditions are too strict for the candidate pool. Try these fixes:

1. **Relax match condition descriptions**: The ingest endpoint may generate overly strict conditions, especially for temporal queries. Edit condition descriptions to be more inclusive before creating the run.
2. **Use a stronger generator**: `preview` evaluates 5–10 candidates according to `match_limit`, `base` searches broadly, `core` searches deeper, and `pro` is the most thorough. A stronger generator evaluates more candidates, increasing the chance of finding matches.
3. **Check temporal language**: Phrases like “founded after 2023” may be interpreted as “within the last year.” Use explicit ranges (e.g., “founded in 2025 or later”) for more predictable behavior.
4. **Broaden your query**: If your criteria are very specific, consider starting broad, adding [enrichments](/findall-api/features/findall-enrich), and filtering the enriched results in your application.
5. **Start with preview**: Always run with `generator: "preview"` first to validate your schema and see how conditions are being evaluated before committing to a full run.

Ingest generated unexpected conditions

The ingest endpoint interprets natural language heuristically. If the generated `match_conditions` don’t match your intent:

1. **Modify the conditions** before passing them to the create endpoint — see [Customizing the ingest schema](#customizing-the-ingest-schema) above.
2. **Skip ingest entirely** and construct your own schema directly with `objective`, `entity_type`, and `match_conditions`.
3. **Use the schema endpoint** on an existing run (`GET /v1beta/findall/runs/{findall_id}/schema`) to see what schema was used, then iterate on it.
