# Deactivate an organization
Learn how to deactivate a Docker organization, including required prerequisite
steps. For information about deactivating user accounts, see
[Deactivate a Docker
account](/accounts/deactivate-user-account/).
> [!WARNING]
>
> All Docker products and services that use this organization are
> inaccessible after you deactivate it. Your individual Docker account
> remains active.
## Prerequisites
You must complete all the following steps before you can deactivate your
organization:
- Download any images and tags you want to keep. Use `docker pull -a `
to pull all tags, or `docker pull :` to pull a specific tag.
- If you have an active Docker subscription, [downgrade it to a basic
organization
account](/subscription/plans/docker/#cancel-a-docker-plan).
- Remove all other members within the organization.
- Unlink your [GitHub and Bitbucket
accounts](/docker-hub/repos/manage/builds/link-source/#unlink-a-github-user-account).
- For Business organizations, [remove your SSO
connection](/enterprise/security/single-sign-on/manage/#delete-a-connection).
