# Migrating email to mailers

Django 6.1 introduced the [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) setting, replacing
[`EMAIL_BACKEND`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_BACKEND) and several other `EMAIL_*` settings. It also
introduced [`mail.mailers`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.mailers "django.core.mail.mailers") for obtaining configured email backend
instances, replacing [`mail.get_connection()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.get_connection "django.core.mail.get_connection"). A new `using` argument
replaces the earlier `connection` in Django functions that send email.

This guide provides details on migrating existing projects to the new mailers
functionality.

All Django projects that send email should:

- If using any third-party packages that send email, [verify their
  compatibility](#migrating-to-mailers-third-party) with [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS)
  before making other changes.
- [Update email-related settings](#migrating-to-mailers-settings).
- Run with deprecation warnings enabled (see
  [Resolving deprecation warnings](../upgrade-version/#resolving-deprecation-warnings)) to identify
  other code needing updates.

  Note

  Running tests may not identify all relevant deprecations. Test suites
  often use a non-functional email backend (such as the memory backend that
  Django [substitutes during tests](../../topics/testing/tools/#topics-testing-email)), so can
  miss deprecation warnings that are only issued from the production email
  configuration.

  Consider running with deprecation warnings enabled in production to catch
  those deprecations. Or carefully review your code (including third-party
  packages) for use of any deprecated email features.

Other updates are needed only for projects or reusable Django libraries that
use these specific features:

- [Replacing get\_connection() and connection arguments](#migrating-to-mailers-get-connection)
- [Replacing fail\_silently](#migrating-to-mailers-fail-silently)
- [Migrating custom email backends](#migrating-to-mailers-email-backends)
- [Replacing auth\_user and auth\_password](#migrating-to-mailers-auth)
- [Updating AdminEmailHandler email\_backend](#migrating-to-mailers-adminemailhandler)

Deprecated since version 6.1: The following settings and functions will be removed in Django 7.0:

- [`EMAIL_BACKEND`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_BACKEND), [`EMAIL_FILE_PATH`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_FILE_PATH),
  [`EMAIL_HOST`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_HOST), [`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD),
  [`EMAIL_HOST_USER`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_HOST_USER), [`EMAIL_PORT`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_PORT),
  [`EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE), [`EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE),
  [`EMAIL_TIMEOUT`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_TIMEOUT), [`EMAIL_USE_SSL`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_USE_SSL),
  [`EMAIL_USE_TLS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_USE_TLS)
- [`mail.get_connection()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.get_connection "django.core.mail.get_connection") and the `connection` arguments to mail
  functions
- The `fail_silently` argument to [`send_mail()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mail "django.core.mail.send_mail"),
  [`send_mass_mail()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mass_mail "django.core.mail.send_mass_mail"), [`mail_admins()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.mail_admins "django.core.mail.mail_admins"), [`mail_managers()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.mail_managers "django.core.mail.mail_managers"),
  and [`EmailMessage.send()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.EmailMessage.send "django.core.mail.EmailMessage.send")
- The `auth_user` and `auth_password` arguments to [`send_mail()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mail "django.core.mail.send_mail")
  and [`send_mass_mail()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mass_mail "django.core.mail.send_mass_mail")
- The `email_backend` argument to [`AdminEmailHandler`](../../ref/logging/#django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler "django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler")

## Migrating settings

Often, the only change needed to migrate to mailers is updating email-related
settings. In your project’s settings, define a [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) dict with a
`"default"` entry matching the earlier `EMAIL_*` settings:

```
MAILERS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": ...,  # value of EMAIL_BACKEND setting
        "OPTIONS": {
            # values from other deprecated EMAIL_* settings
            ...,
        },
    },
}
```

For example, to update these settings:

```
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST = "mail.example.net"
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "user@example.net"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "password"
```

use:

```
MAILERS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "host": "mail.example.net",
            "use_tls": True,
            # port is not needed: it defaults to 587 with use_tls True.
            "username": "user@example.net",
            "password": "password",
        },
    },
}
```

The complete list of deprecated `EMAIL_*` settings and where they should be
moved in a [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) configuration is:

- [`EMAIL_BACKEND`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_BACKEND) becomes `"BACKEND"`. If your settings didn’t
  define `EMAIL_BACKEND`, the default value was
  `"django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"` (which is also the default
  if a [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) configuration doesn’t specify the `"BACKEND"`).
- [`EMAIL_FILE_PATH`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_FILE_PATH) becomes `"file_path"` in `"OPTIONS"` (with
  `"BACKEND"` set to `"django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend"`).
- [`EMAIL_HOST`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_HOST) becomes `"host"` in `"OPTIONS"`. A `"host"` is
  required for the SMTP email backend. If your settings didn’t define
  `EMAIL_HOST`, set `"host"` to `"localhost"` (the default value for the
  deprecated setting).
- [`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD) becomes `"password"` in `"OPTIONS"`.
- [`EMAIL_HOST_USER`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_HOST_USER) becomes `"username"` in `"OPTIONS"`. (Note
  `"username"` doesn’t quite follow the naming pattern for the other
  deprecated settings.)
- [`EMAIL_PORT`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_PORT) becomes `"port"` in `"OPTIONS"`. It can be omitted
  if the connection uses the default port for its security (465 for SSL, 587
  for TLS, or 25 for an unsecured SMTP connection).
- [`EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE) becomes `"ssl_certfile"` in `"OPTIONS"`.
- [`EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE) becomes `"ssl_keyfile"` in `"OPTIONS"`.
- [`EMAIL_TIMEOUT`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_TIMEOUT) becomes `"timeout"` in `"OPTIONS"`.
- [`EMAIL_USE_SSL`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_USE_SSL) becomes `"use_ssl"` in `"OPTIONS"`.
- [`EMAIL_USE_TLS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_USE_TLS) becomes `"use_tls"` in `"OPTIONS"`.

For third-party or custom email backends, the available `"OPTIONS"` depend on
the backend. Refer to the third-party documentation, or for custom backends see
[Migrating custom email backends](#migrating-to-mailers-email-backends) below.

The [Configuring email](../../topics/email/#topic-email-configuration) topic has more information on the
`MAILERS` setting and additional configuration examples.

## Reusable library readiness

In most cases, third-party packages that send email through Django will
continue working with projects whose settings have been upgraded to use
[`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS). (If they use any deprecated mail features, those will of
course cause deprecation warnings.)

There are two deprecated features that are *not* supported when
[`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) is defined in a project’s settings:

- Trying to access any of the deprecated `EMAIL_*` settings on
  `django.conf.settings` (e.g., checking `settings.EMAIL_BACKEND` or using
  `settings.EMAIL_HOST_USER`).
- Calling [`mail.get_connection("path.to.EmailBackend")`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.get_connection "django.core.mail.get_connection") with a specific backend path. (Other arguments to
  `get_connection()` are still supported, and will simply issue deprecation
  warnings when [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) is defined.)

If a third-party package does either of those, projects that use it will not be
able to change to the [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) setting until the package has been
updated.

### Solving “not available when MAILERS is defined” errors

If either of these errors are raised within a third-party package, that
indicates it is not compatible with the [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) setting:

- `AttributeError: "The name setting is not available when MAILERS is
  defined"` where *name* is [`EMAIL_BACKEND`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_BACKEND), [`EMAIL_HOST`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_HOST),
  or one of the other deprecated settings.
- `RuntimeError: get_connection(backend, ...) is not supported with MAILERS.`

If you see these errors, check if a newer version of that dependency is
available. If not (and if there are no alternatives to that package), you will
need to remove [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) from your settings and replace it with the
equivalent [deprecated email settings](#deprecated-email-settings) until
the package has been updated.

If those errors are coming from your own code, see the other sections in this
migration guide for recommended updates.

## Replacing `get_connection()` and `connection` arguments

The replacements for the deprecated [`mail.get_connection()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.get_connection "django.core.mail.get_connection") function
and `connection` arguments to other mail functions depend on how and why
the connections are being created:

- `get_connection()` called with no arguments

  Replace with [`mailers.default`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.mailers.default "django.core.mail.mailers.default"). For example, update this code:

  ```
  connection = mail.get_connection()
  connection.send_messages([email1, email2])
  ```

  To:

  ```
  connection = mail.mailers.default
  connection.send_messages([email1, email2])
  ```

  Note that `mailers.default` *is* the default for Django’s mail-sending
  functions. Code like this:

  ```
  mail.send_mail(..., connection=mail.get_connection())
  ```

  can be updated to:

  ```
  mail.send_mail(...)  # No connection arg needed.
  ```
- `get_connection(fail_silently=True)`

  See [Replacing fail\_silently](#migrating-to-mailers-fail-silently).
- `get_connection(...)` called with any other arguments

  Define a custom [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) configuration with the desired backend
  and options. Then refer to it in the `using` argument when sending mail,
  or obtain an email backend instance from [`mail.mailers`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.mailers "django.core.mail.mailers") with the
  configuration name.

  For example, to upgrade this code:

  ```
  connection = mail.get_connection(
      "path.to.custom.EmailBackend", option1=True, option2="value"
  )
  mail.send_mail(..., connection=connection)
  connection.send_messages([email1, email2])
  ```

  Define a custom [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) configuration in your settings:

  ```
  MAILERS = {
      "default": {...},
      "custom": {
          "BACKEND": "path.to.custom.EmailBackend",
          "OPTIONS": {
              "option1": True,
              "option2": "value",
          },
      },
  }
  ```

  And then use it like this:

  ```
  mail.send_mail(..., using="custom")
  mail.mailers["custom"].send_messages([email1, email2])
  ```

## Replacing `fail_silently`

The deprecated `fail_silently` arguments to [`send_mail()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mail "django.core.mail.send_mail"),
[`send_mass_mail()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mass_mail "django.core.mail.send_mass_mail"), [`mail_admins()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.mail_admins "django.core.mail.mail_admins"), [`mail_managers()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.mail_managers "django.core.mail.mail_managers"), and
[`EmailMessage.send()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.EmailMessage.send "django.core.mail.EmailMessage.send") can be replaced in several ways. Existing usage
seems to have several different expectations for the behavior, many of which
don’t match the actual (and email backend-dependent) implementation. Consider
removing `fail_silently` entirely if there is not a specific need for it.

Calls with `fail_silently=True` should be updated with one of these options,
depending on the caller’s intent:

- To send a message if email has been configured but avoid raising an error
  if it hasn’t (e.g., in a reusable library), wrap the send call in `try:` /
  `except mail.MailerDoesNotExist: pass`.
- To ignore *all* exceptions (e.g., to avoid cascading failures in an error
  handler that sends mail), wrap the send call in `try:` / `except
  Exception: pass`.
- To ignore only SMTP-related errors, wrap the send call in `try` /
  `except OSError: pass`. Note that this ignores both transient network
  glitches *and* SMTP configuration problems (just like the existing SMTP
  email backend `fail_silently` implementation).
- To ignore end user typos in `to` addresses and other delivery problems,
  remove the `fail_silently` argument. Recipient errors are not generally
  detected at send time, so using `fail_silently` for this purpose doesn’t
  accomplish anything and could mask other problems like configuration errors.

  (In *local delivery* configurations, SMTP servers may report some recipient
  errors at send time. If you are using `fail_silently` specifically to
  ignore those errors, consider instead intercepting
  [`SMTPRecipientsRefused`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#smtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused "(in Python v3.14)") and/or
  [`SMTPResponseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#smtplib.SMTPResponseException "(in Python v3.14)")s with particular `smtp_code`
  values as a more precise filter.)
- To create an email configuration that ignores certain backend-dependent
  errors and reuse it for multiple sending operations, create a custom
  [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) configuration with `"fail_silently": True` in the
  [`"OPTIONS"`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS-OPTIONS), then refer to that configuration
  with `using` in the send call.

Calls with `fail_silently=False` should be updated to remove the
`fail_silently` arg, as that is the default.

## Migrating custom email backends

Custom `EmailBackend` implementations may need to be updated for
compatibility with mailers.

- In the backend’s `__init__()` method, accept explicit keyword arguments for
  all configuration options that can come from [`"OPTIONS"`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS-OPTIONS). Backends that use custom settings for configuration can
  continue to do so (or not, as they choose), but keyword arguments should take
  precedence over settings.
- Accept variable `**kwargs` and pass them to superclass init. (This will
  include a new `alias` argument which must be passed to the superclass.)
  Ensure that any `**kwargs` used by the backend are *not* passed to
  superclass init, as that would generate an `InvalidMailer` error for
  unknown OPTIONS.
- Backends must now handle `fail_silently` themselves, if they want to
  support it. There is no requirement to support `fail_silently`, and
  backends that don’t offer it should eliminate that keyword argument. (Do not
  pass an explicit `fail_silently` arg to superclass init.)
- Do not accept variable positional `*args` or pass them to superclass init.

The `BaseEmailBackend` superclass now initializes an `alias` attribute.
This is useful for error messages (e.g., `raise InvalidMailer(f"Bad host
{host}", alias=self.alias)`), but should not be used for accessing
`settings.MAILERS` directly. All OPTIONS for a mailer configuration are
passed to backend init as keyword arguments.

For reusable libraries that want to support compatibility with deprecated mail
functions and settings, or that support older Django versions:

- A backend can detect it is being initialized without [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) by
  checking if `self.alias is None`. (Django’s built-in backends check this to
  decide whether deprecated settings should be used.) Libraries supporting
  older Django versions will need to use `getattr(self, "alias", None)`.
- Backends that borrow Django’s SMTP email settings like [`EMAIL_HOST`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-EMAIL_HOST)
  must *not* try to access them when [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) is in use (`self.alias
  is not None`), as this will cause a “not available when MAILERS is defined”
  `AttributeError`.
- Libraries supporting multiple Django versions can identify support for
  mailers with either `hasattr(django.core.mail, "mailers")` or
  `django.VERSION >= (6, 1)`.

## Replacing `auth_user` and `auth_password`

The deprecated `auth_user` and `auth_password` arguments to
[`send_mail()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mail "django.core.mail.send_mail") and [`send_mass_mail()`](../../topics/email/#django.core.mail.send_mass_mail "django.core.mail.send_mass_mail") can be replaced by defining a
custom [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) configuration with
`"username"` and `"password"` [`"OPTIONS"`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS-OPTIONS), and
refer to that configuration with the `using` argument when sending mail.

For example, to upgrade:

```
mail.send_mail(..., auth_user="admin", auth_password="admin-password")
```

Add a custom [`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) configuration in your settings:

```
MAILERS = {
    # Existing default configuration.
    "default": {
        "OPTIONS": {
            "host": "smtp.example.com",
            "username": "default-user",
            "password": "default-password",
        },
    },
    # Duplicate the default configuration, changing the auth.
    "admin-config": {
        "OPTIONS": {
            "host": "smtp.example.com",
            "username": "admin",
            "password": "admin-password",
        },
    },
}
```

And then refer to it when sending:

```
mail.send_mail(..., using="admin-config")
```

## Updating AdminEmailHandler `email_backend`

The deprecated `email_backend` argument to the logging
[`AdminEmailHandler`](../../ref/logging/#django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler "django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler") can be replaced with a custom
[`MAILERS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-MAILERS) configuration, referring to it with the `using`
argument.

For example, if your settings include:

```
LOGGING = {
    # ...
    "handlers": {
        "mail_admins": {
            "class": "django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler",
            "email_backend": "third.party.EmailBackend",
        },
    },
    # ...
}
```

Replace that with:

```
LOGGING = {
    # ...
    "handlers": {
        "mail_admins": {
            "class": "django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler",
            "using": "admin-logging",  # defined in MAILERS
        },
    },
    # ...
}

MAILERS = {
    "default": {...},
    "admin-logging": {
        "BACKEND": "third.party.EmailBackend",
    },
}
```
