# How to delete a Django application

Django provides the ability to group sets of features into Python packages
called [applications](../../ref/applications/). When requirements change, apps
may become obsolete or unnecessary. The following steps will help you delete an
application safely.

1. Remove all references to the app (imports, foreign keys etc.).
2. Remove all models from the corresponding `models.py` file.
3. Create relevant migrations by running [`makemigrations`](../../ref/django-admin/#django-admin-makemigrations). This step
   generates a migration that deletes tables for the removed models, and any
   other required migration for updating relationships connected to those
   models.
4. [Squash](../../topics/migrations/#migration-squashing) out references to the app in other apps’
   migrations.
5. Apply migrations locally, run tests, and verify the correctness of your
   project.
6. Deploy/release your updated Django project.
7. Remove the app from [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../../ref/settings/#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS).
8. Finally, remove the app’s directory.
