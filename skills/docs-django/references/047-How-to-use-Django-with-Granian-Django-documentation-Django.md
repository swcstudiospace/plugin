# How to use Django with Granian

[Granian](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian) is a Rust-based high-performance HTTP server for Python applications,
supporting ASGI and WSGI interfaces.

## Installing Granian

You can install Granian with `pip`:

```
python -m pip install granian
```

## Running Django in Granian

When Granian is installed, a `granian` command is available which runs WSGI
applications. Granian needs to be called with the location of a module
containing a WSGI application object named `application`, using the
`--interface wsgi` option.

For a typical Django project, invoking Granian would look like:

```
granian myproject.wsgi:application --interface wsgi
```

This will start one process listening on `127.0.0.1:8000`. It requires that
your project be on the Python path; to ensure that, run this command from the
same directory as your `manage.py` file.

For more advanced usage, please read the [Granian documentation](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian).
