## Getting help

Having trouble? We’d like to help!

- Try the [FAQ](faq/) – it’s got answers to many common questions.
- Looking for specific information? Try the [Index](genindex/), [Module Index](py-modindex/) or
  the [detailed table of contents](contents/).
- Not found anything? See [FAQ: Getting Help](faq/help/) for information on getting support
  and asking questions to the community.
- Report bugs with Django in our [ticket tracker](https://code.djangoproject.com/).

## How the documentation is organized

Django has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized
will help you know where to look for certain things:

- [Tutorials](intro/) take you by the hand through a series of
  steps to create a web application. Start here if you’re new to Django or web
  application development. Also look at the “[First steps](#index-first-steps)”.
- [Topic guides](topics/) discuss key topics and concepts at a
  fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Reference guides](ref/) contain technical reference for APIs and
  other aspects of Django’s machinery. They describe how it works and how to
  use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
- [How-to guides](howto/) are recipes. They guide you through the
  steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more
  advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Django works.

manipulating the data of your web application. Learn more about it below:
