# `base64` — Base16, Base32, Base64, Base85 Data Encodings

**Source code:** [Lib/base64.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/base64.py)

---

This module provides functions for encoding binary data to printable
ASCII characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data.
This includes the [encodings specified in](#base64-rfc-4648)
[**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html) (Base64, Base32 and Base16), the [Base85 encoding](#base64-base-85) specified in [PDF 2.0](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-32000-2/), and non-standard variants
of Base85 used elsewhere.

There are two interfaces provided by this module. The modern interface
supports encoding [bytes-like objects](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) to ASCII
[`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes"), and decoding bytes-like objects or
strings containing ASCII to `bytes`. Both base-64 alphabets
defined in [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html) (normal, and URL- and filesystem-safe) are supported.

The [legacy interface](#base64-legacy) does not support decoding from strings, but it does
provide functions for encoding and decoding to and from [file objects](../glossary.html#term-file-object). It only supports the Base64 standard alphabet, and it adds
newlines every 76 characters as per [**RFC 2045**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045.html). Note that if you are looking
for [**RFC 2045**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045.html) support you probably want to be looking at the [`email`](email.html#module-email "email: Package supporting the parsing, manipulating, and generating email messages.")
package instead.

Changed in version 3.3: ASCII-only Unicode strings are now accepted by the decoding functions of
the modern interface.

Changed in version 3.4: Any [bytes-like objects](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) are now accepted by all
encoding and decoding functions in this module. Ascii85/Base85 support added.

## RFC 4648 Encodings

The [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html) encodings are suitable for encoding binary data so that it can be
safely sent by email, used as parts of URLs, or included as part of an HTTP
POST request.

base64.b64encode(*s*, *altchars=None*)
:   Encode the [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *s* using Base64 and return the encoded
    [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    Optional *altchars* must be a [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) of length 2 which
    specifies an alternative alphabet for the `+` and `/` characters.
    This allows an application to e.g. generate URL or filesystem safe Base64
    strings. The default is `None`, for which the standard Base64 alphabet is used.

    May assert or raise a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if the length of *altchars* is not 2. Raises a
    [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") if *altchars* is not a [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object).

base64.b64decode(*s*, *altchars=None*, *validate=False*)
:   Decode the Base64 encoded [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or ASCII string
    *s* and return the decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    Optional *altchars* must be a [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or ASCII string
    of length 2 which specifies the alternative alphabet used instead of the
    `+` and `/` characters.

    A [`binascii.Error`](binascii.html#binascii.Error "binascii.Error") exception is raised
    if *s* is incorrectly padded.

    If *validate* is `False` (the default), characters that are neither
    in the normal base-64 alphabet nor the alternative alphabet are
    discarded prior to the padding check. If *validate* is `True`,
    these non-alphabet characters in the input result in a
    [`binascii.Error`](binascii.html#binascii.Error "binascii.Error").

    For more information about the strict base64 check, see [`binascii.a2b_base64()`](binascii.html#binascii.a2b_base64 "binascii.a2b_base64")

    May assert or raise a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if the length of *altchars* is not 2.

base64.standard\_b64encode(*s*)
:   Encode [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *s* using the standard Base64 alphabet
    and return the encoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

base64.standard\_b64decode(*s*)
:   Decode [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or ASCII string *s* using the standard
    Base64 alphabet and return the decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

base64.urlsafe\_b64encode(*s*)
:   Encode [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *s* using the
    URL- and filesystem-safe alphabet, which
    substitutes `-` instead of `+` and `_` instead of `/` in the
    standard Base64 alphabet, and return the encoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes"). The result
    can still contain `=`.

base64.urlsafe\_b64decode(*s*)
:   Decode [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or ASCII string *s*
    using the URL- and filesystem-safe
    alphabet, which substitutes `-` instead of `+` and `_` instead of
    `/` in the standard Base64 alphabet, and return the decoded
    [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

base64.b32encode(*s*)
:   Encode the [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *s* using Base32 and return the
    encoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

base64.b32decode(*s*, *casefold=False*, *map01=None*)
:   Decode the Base32 encoded [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or ASCII string *s* and
    return the decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    Optional *casefold* is a flag specifying
    whether a lowercase alphabet is acceptable as input. For security purposes,
    the default is `False`.

    [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html) allows for optional mapping of the digit 0 (zero) to the letter O
    (oh), and for optional mapping of the digit 1 (one) to either the letter I (eye)
    or letter L (el). The optional argument *map01* when not `None`, specifies
    which letter the digit 1 should be mapped to (when *map01* is not `None`, the
    digit 0 is always mapped to the letter O). For security purposes the default is
    `None`, so that 0 and 1 are not allowed in the input.

    A [`binascii.Error`](binascii.html#binascii.Error "binascii.Error") is raised if *s* is
    incorrectly padded or if there are non-alphabet characters present in the
    input.

base64.b32hexencode(*s*)
:   Similar to [`b32encode()`](#base64.b32encode "base64.b32encode") but uses the Extended Hex Alphabet, as defined in
    [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html).

    Added in version 3.10.

base64.b32hexdecode(*s*, *casefold=False*)
:   Similar to [`b32decode()`](#base64.b32decode "base64.b32decode") but uses the Extended Hex Alphabet, as defined in
    [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html).

    This version does not allow the digit 0 (zero) to the letter O (oh) and digit
    1 (one) to either the letter I (eye) or letter L (el) mappings, all these
    characters are included in the Extended Hex Alphabet and are not
    interchangeable.

    Added in version 3.10.

base64.b16encode(*s*)
:   Encode the [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *s* using Base16 and return the
    encoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

base64.b16decode(*s*, *casefold=False*)
:   Decode the Base16 encoded [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or ASCII string *s* and
    return the decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    Optional *casefold* is a flag specifying whether a
    lowercase alphabet is acceptable as input. For security purposes, the default
    is `False`.

    A [`binascii.Error`](binascii.html#binascii.Error "binascii.Error") is raised if *s* is
    incorrectly padded or if there are non-alphabet characters present in the
    input.

## Base85 Encodings

Base85 encoding is a family of algorithms which represent four bytes
using five ASCII characters. Originally implemented in the Unix
`btoa(1)` utility, a version of it was later adopted by Adobe in the
PostScript language and is standardized in PDF 2.0 (ISO 32000-2).
This version, in both its `btoa` and PDF variants, is implemented by
[`a85encode()`](#base64.a85encode "base64.a85encode").

A separate version, using a different output character set, was
defined as an April Fool’s joke in [**RFC 1924**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1924.html) but is now used by Git
and other software. This version is implemented by [`b85encode()`](#base64.b85encode "base64.b85encode").

Finally, a third version, using yet another output character set
designed for safe inclusion in programming language strings, is
defined by ZeroMQ and implemented here by [`z85encode()`](#base64.z85encode "base64.z85encode").

The functions present in this module differ in how they handle the following:

- Whether to include and expect enclosing `<~` and `~>` markers.
- Whether to fold the input into multiple lines.
- The set of ASCII characters used for encoding.
- Compact encodings of sequences of spaces and null bytes.
- The encoding of zero-padding bytes applied to the input.

Refer to the documentation of the individual functions for more information.

base64.a85encode(*b*, *\**, *foldspaces=False*, *wrapcol=0*, *pad=False*, *adobe=False*)
:   Encode the [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *b* using Ascii85 and return the
    encoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    *foldspaces* is an optional flag that uses the special short sequence ‘y’
    instead of 4 consecutive spaces (ASCII 0x20) as supported by ‘btoa’. This
    feature is not supported by the standard encoding used in PDF.

    *wrapcol* controls whether the output should have newline (`b'\n'`)
    characters added to it. If this is non-zero, each output line will be
    at most this many characters long, excluding the trailing newline.

    *pad* controls whether zero-padding applied to the end of the input
    is fully retained in the output encoding, as done by `btoa`,
    producing an exact multiple of 5 bytes of output. This is not part
    of the standard encoding used in PDF, as it does not preserve the
    length of the data.

    *adobe* controls whether the encoded byte sequence is framed with
    `<~` and `~>`, as in a PostScript base-85 string literal. Note
    that while ASCII85Decode streams in PDF documents *must* be
    terminated with `~>`, they *must not* use a leading `<~`.

    Added in version 3.4.

base64.a85decode(*b*, *\**, *foldspaces=False*, *adobe=False*, *ignorechars=b' \t\n\r\x0b'*)
:   Decode the Ascii85 encoded [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or ASCII string *b* and
    return the decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    *foldspaces* is a flag that specifies whether the ‘y’ short sequence
    should be accepted as shorthand for 4 consecutive spaces (ASCII 0x20).
    This feature is not supported by the standard Ascii85 encoding used in
    PDF and PostScript.

    *adobe* controls whether the `<~` and `~>` markers are
    present. While the leading `<~` is not required, the input must
    end with `~>`, or a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised.

    *ignorechars* should be a byte string containing characters to ignore
    from the input. This should only contain whitespace characters, and by
    default contains all whitespace characters in ASCII.

    Added in version 3.4.

base64.b85encode(*b*, *pad=False*)
:   Encode the [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *b* using base85 (as used in e.g.
    git-style binary diffs) and return the encoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    The input is padded with `b'\0'` so its length is a multiple of 4
    bytes before encoding. If *pad* is true, all the resulting
    characters are retained in the output, which will always be a
    multiple of 5 bytes, and thus the length of the data may not be
    preserved on decoding.

    Added in version 3.4.

base64.b85decode(*b*)
:   Decode the base85-encoded [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or ASCII string *b* and
    return the decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    Added in version 3.4.

base64.z85encode(*s*)
:   Encode the [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *s* using Z85 (as used in ZeroMQ)
    and return the encoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    The [ZeroMQ specification](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/32/)
    requires the length of Z85-encoded data to be a multiple of 5
    bytes. To produce compliant data frames, you must pad the input
    data to this function to a multiple of 4 bytes.

    Added in version 3.13.

base64.z85decode(*s*)
:   Decode the Z85-encoded [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) or ASCII string *s* and
    return the decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    Added in version 3.13.

## Legacy Interface

base64.decode(*input*, *output*)
:   Decode the contents of the binary *input* file and write the resulting binary
    data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must be [file objects](../glossary.html#term-file-object). *input* will be read until `input.readline()` returns an
    empty bytes object.

base64.decodebytes(*s*)
:   Decode the [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *s*, which must contain one or more
    lines of base64 encoded data, and return the decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes").

    Added in version 3.1.

base64.encode(*input*, *output*)
:   Encode the contents of the binary *input* file and write the resulting base64
    encoded data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must be [file
    objects](../glossary.html#term-file-object). *input* will be read until `input.read()` returns
    an empty bytes object. `encode()` inserts a newline character (`b'\n'`)
    after every 76 bytes of the output, as well as ensuring that the output
    always ends with a newline, as per [**RFC 2045**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045.html) (MIME).

base64.encodebytes(*s*)
:   Encode the [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) *s*, which can contain arbitrary binary
    data, and return [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") containing the base64-encoded data, with newlines
    (`b'\n'`) inserted after every 76 bytes of output, and ensuring that
    there is a trailing newline, as per [**RFC 2045**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045.html) (MIME).

    Added in version 3.1.

An example usage of the module:

```
>>> import base64
>>> encoded = base64.b64encode(b'data to be encoded')
>>> encoded
b'ZGF0YSB0byBiZSBlbmNvZGVk'
>>> data = base64.b64decode(encoded)
>>> data
b'data to be encoded'
```

## Security Considerations

A new security considerations section was added to [**RFC 4648**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html) (section 12); it’s
recommended to review the security section for any code deployed to production.
