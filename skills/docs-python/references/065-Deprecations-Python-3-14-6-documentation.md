# Deprecations

## Pending removal in Python 3.15

- The import system:

  - Setting [`__cached__`](../reference/datamodel.html#module.__cached__ "module.__cached__") on a module while
    failing to set [`__spec__.cached`](../library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.cached "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.cached")
    is deprecated. In Python 3.15, `__cached__` will cease to be set or
    take into consideration by the import system or standard library. ([gh-97879](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97879))
  - Setting [`__package__`](../reference/datamodel.html#module.__package__ "module.__package__") on a module while
    failing to set [`__spec__.parent`](../library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.parent "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.parent")
    is deprecated. In Python 3.15, `__package__` will cease to be set or
    take into consideration by the import system or standard library. ([gh-97879](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97879))
- [`ctypes`](../library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python."):

  - The undocumented `ctypes.SetPointerType()` function
    has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
- [`http.server`](../library/http.server.html#module-http.server "http.server: HTTP server and request handlers."):

  - The obsolete and rarely used [`CGIHTTPRequestHandler`](../library/http.server.html#http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler "http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler")
    has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
    No direct replacement exists.
    *Anything* is better than CGI to interface
    a web server with a request handler.
  - The `--cgi` flag to the **python -m http.server**
    command-line interface has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
- [`importlib`](../library/importlib.html#module-importlib "importlib: The implementation of the import machinery."):

  - `load_module()` method: use `exec_module()` instead.
- [`pathlib`](../library/pathlib.html#module-pathlib "pathlib: Object-oriented filesystem paths"):

  - [`PurePath.is_reserved()`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.is_reserved "pathlib.PurePath.is_reserved")
    has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
    Use [`os.path.isreserved()`](../library/os.path.html#os.path.isreserved "os.path.isreserved") to detect reserved paths on Windows.
- [`platform`](../library/platform.html#module-platform "platform: Retrieves as much platform identifying data as possible."):

  - [`java_ver()`](../library/platform.html#platform.java_ver "platform.java_ver") has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
    This function is only useful for Jython support, has a confusing API,
    and is largely untested.
- [`sysconfig`](../library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information"):

  - The *check\_home* argument of [`sysconfig.is_python_build()`](../library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.is_python_build "sysconfig.is_python_build") has been
    deprecated since Python 3.12.
- [`threading`](../library/threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism."):

  - [`RLock()`](../library/threading.html#threading.RLock "threading.RLock") will take no arguments in Python 3.15.
    Passing any arguments has been deprecated since Python 3.14,
    as the Python version does not permit any arguments,
    but the C version allows any number of positional or keyword arguments,
    ignoring every argument.
- [`types`](../library/types.html#module-types "types: Names for built-in types."):

  - [`types.CodeType`](../library/types.html#types.CodeType "types.CodeType"): Accessing [`co_lnotab`](../reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_lnotab "codeobject.co_lnotab") was
    deprecated in [**PEP 626**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0626/)
    since 3.10 and was planned to be removed in 3.12,
    but it only got a proper [`DeprecationWarning`](../library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") in 3.12.
    May be removed in 3.15.
    (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in [gh-101866](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101866).)
- [`typing`](../library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints (see :pep:`484`)."):

  - The undocumented keyword argument syntax for creating
    [`NamedTuple`](../library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple "typing.NamedTuple") classes
    (for example, `Point = NamedTuple("Point", x=int, y=int)`)
    has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
    Use the class-based syntax or the functional syntax instead.
  - When using the functional syntax of [`TypedDict`](../library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict")s, failing
    to pass a value to the *fields* parameter (`TD = TypedDict("TD")`) or
    passing `None` (`TD = TypedDict("TD", None)`) has been deprecated
    since Python 3.13.
    Use `class TD(TypedDict): pass` or `TD = TypedDict("TD", {})`
    to create a TypedDict with zero field.
  - The [`typing.no_type_check_decorator()`](../library/typing.html#typing.no_type_check_decorator "typing.no_type_check_decorator") decorator function
    has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
    After eight years in the [`typing`](../library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints (see :pep:`484`).") module,
    it has yet to be supported by any major type checker.
- [`wave`](../library/wave.html#module-wave "wave: Provide an interface to the WAV sound format."):

  - The [`getmark()`](../library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getmark "wave.Wave_read.getmark"), `setmark()`,
    and [`getmarkers()`](../library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getmarkers "wave.Wave_read.getmarkers") methods of
    the [`Wave_read`](../library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read "wave.Wave_read") and [`Wave_write`](../library/wave.html#wave.Wave_write "wave.Wave_write") classes
    have been deprecated since Python 3.13.
- [`zipimport`](../library/zipimport.html#module-zipimport "zipimport: Support for importing Python modules from ZIP archives."):

  - [`load_module()`](../library/zipimport.html#zipimport.zipimporter.load_module "zipimport.zipimporter.load_module") has been deprecated since
    Python 3.10. Use [`exec_module()`](../library/zipimport.html#zipimport.zipimporter.exec_module "zipimport.zipimporter.exec_module") instead.
    (Contributed by Jiahao Li in [gh-125746](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125746).)

## Pending removal in Python 3.16

- The import system:

  - Setting [`__loader__`](../reference/datamodel.html#module.__loader__ "module.__loader__") on a module while
    failing to set [`__spec__.loader`](../library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.loader "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.loader")
    is deprecated. In Python 3.16, `__loader__` will cease to be set or
    taken into consideration by the import system or the standard library.
- [`array`](../library/array.html#module-array "array: Space efficient arrays of uniformly typed numeric values."):

  - The `'u'` format code (`wchar_t`)
    has been deprecated in documentation since Python 3.3
    and at runtime since Python 3.13.
    Use the `'w'` format code ([`Py_UCS4`](../c-api/unicode.html#c.Py_UCS4 "Py_UCS4"))
    for Unicode characters instead.
- [`asyncio`](../library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O."):

  - `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` is deprecated
    and will be removed in Python 3.16;
    use [`inspect.iscoroutinefunction()`](../library/inspect.html#inspect.iscoroutinefunction "inspect.iscoroutinefunction") instead.
    (Contributed by Jiahao Li and Kumar Aditya in [gh-122875](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122875).)
  - [`asyncio`](../library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") policy system is deprecated and will be removed in Python 3.16.
    In particular, the following classes and functions are deprecated:

    - [`asyncio.AbstractEventLoopPolicy`](../library/asyncio-policy.html#asyncio.AbstractEventLoopPolicy "asyncio.AbstractEventLoopPolicy")
    - [`asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy`](../library/asyncio-policy.html#asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy "asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy")
    - [`asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy`](../library/asyncio-policy.html#asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy "asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy")
    - [`asyncio.WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy`](../library/asyncio-policy.html#asyncio.WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy "asyncio.WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy")
    - [`asyncio.get_event_loop_policy()`](../library/asyncio-policy.html#asyncio.get_event_loop_policy "asyncio.get_event_loop_policy")
    - [`asyncio.set_event_loop_policy()`](../library/asyncio-policy.html#asyncio.set_event_loop_policy "asyncio.set_event_loop_policy")

    Users should use [`asyncio.run()`](../library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run "asyncio.run") or [`asyncio.Runner`](../library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner "asyncio.Runner") with
    *loop\_factory* to use the desired event loop implementation.

    For example, to use [`asyncio.SelectorEventLoop`](../library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.SelectorEventLoop "asyncio.SelectorEventLoop") on Windows:

    ```
    import asyncio

    async def main():
        ...

    asyncio.run(main(), loop_factory=asyncio.SelectorEventLoop)
    ```

- [`builtins`](../library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."):

  - Bitwise inversion on boolean types, `~True` or `~False`
    has been deprecated since Python 3.12,
    as it produces surprising and unintuitive results (`-2` and `-1`).
    Use `not x` instead for the logical negation of a Boolean.
    In the rare case that you need the bitwise inversion of
    the underlying integer, convert to `int` explicitly (`~int(x)`).
- [`functools`](../library/functools.html#module-functools "functools: Higher-order functions and operations on callable objects."):

  - Calling the Python implementation of [`functools.reduce()`](../library/functools.html#functools.reduce "functools.reduce") with *function*
    or *sequence* as keyword arguments has been deprecated since Python 3.14.
- [`logging`](../library/logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications."):

  Support for custom logging handlers with the *strm* argument is deprecated
  and scheduled for removal in Python 3.16. Define handlers with the *stream*
  argument instead. (Contributed by Mariusz Felisiak in [gh-115032](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115032).)
- [`mimetypes`](../library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes "mimetypes: Mapping of filename extensions to MIME types."):

  - Valid extensions start with a ‘.’ or are empty for
    [`mimetypes.MimeTypes.add_type()`](../library/mimetypes.html#mimetypes.MimeTypes.add_type "mimetypes.MimeTypes.add_type").
    Undotted extensions are deprecated and will
    raise a [`ValueError`](../library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") in Python 3.16.
    (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-75223](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/75223).)
- [`shutil`](../library/shutil.html#module-shutil "shutil: High-level file operations, including copying."):

  - The `ExecError` exception
    has been deprecated since Python 3.14.
    It has not been used by any function in `shutil` since Python 3.4,
    and is now an alias of [`RuntimeError`](../library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError").
- [`symtable`](../library/symtable.html#module-symtable "symtable: Interface to the compiler's internal symbol tables."):

  - The [`Class.get_methods`](../library/symtable.html#symtable.Class.get_methods "symtable.Class.get_methods") method
    has been deprecated since Python 3.14.
- [`sys`](../library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions."):

  - The [`_enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()`](../library/sys.html#sys._enablelegacywindowsfsencoding "sys._enablelegacywindowsfsencoding") function
    has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
    Use the [`PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING) environment variable instead.
- [`sysconfig`](../library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information"):

  - The `sysconfig.expand_makefile_vars()` function
    has been deprecated since Python 3.14.
    Use the `vars` argument of [`sysconfig.get_paths()`](../library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.get_paths "sysconfig.get_paths") instead.
- [`tarfile`](../library/tarfile.html#module-tarfile "tarfile: Read and write tar-format archive files."):

  - The undocumented and unused `TarFile.tarfile` attribute
    has been deprecated since Python 3.13.

## Pending removal in Python 3.17

- [`collections.abc`](../library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers"):

  - [`collections.abc.ByteString`](../library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.ByteString "collections.abc.ByteString") is scheduled for removal in Python 3.17.

    Use `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer)` to test if `obj`
    implements the [buffer protocol](../c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) at runtime. For use
    in type annotations, either use [`Buffer`](../library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Buffer "collections.abc.Buffer") or a union
    that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g.,
    `bytes | bytearray | memoryview`).

    `ByteString` was originally intended to be an abstract class that
    would serve as a supertype of both [`bytes`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`bytearray`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray").
    However, since the ABC never had any methods, knowing that an object was an
    instance of `ByteString` never actually told you anything useful
    about the object. Other common buffer types such as [`memoryview`](../library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview")
    were also never understood as subtypes of `ByteString` (either at
    runtime or by static type checkers).

    See [**PEP 688**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0688/#current-options) for more details.
    (Contributed by Shantanu Jain in [gh-91896](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91896).)
- [`typing`](../library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints (see :pep:`484`)."):

  - Before Python 3.14, old-style unions were implemented using the private class
    `typing._UnionGenericAlias`. This class is no longer needed for the implementation,
    but it has been retained for backward compatibility, with removal scheduled for Python
    3.17. Users should use documented introspection helpers like [`typing.get_origin()`](../library/typing.html#typing.get_origin "typing.get_origin")
    and [`typing.get_args()`](../library/typing.html#typing.get_args "typing.get_args") instead of relying on private implementation details.
  - [`typing.ByteString`](../library/typing.html#typing.ByteString "typing.ByteString"), deprecated since Python 3.9, is scheduled for removal in
    Python 3.17.

    Use `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer)` to test if `obj`
    implements the [buffer protocol](../c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) at runtime. For use
    in type annotations, either use [`Buffer`](../library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Buffer "collections.abc.Buffer") or a union
    that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g.,
    `bytes | bytearray | memoryview`).

    `ByteString` was originally intended to be an abstract class that

    instance of `ByteString` never actually told you anything useful
    about the object. Other common buffer types such as [`memoryview`](../library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview")
    were also never understood as subtypes of `ByteString` (either at

## Pending removal in Python 3.18

- [`decimal`](../library/decimal.html#module-decimal "decimal: Implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification."):

  - The non-standard and undocumented [`Decimal`](../library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") format
    specifier `'N'`, which is only supported in the `decimal` module’s
    C implementation, has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
    (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-89902](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89902).)

## Pending removal in Python 3.19

- [`ctypes`](../library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python."):

  - Implicitly switching to the MSVC-compatible struct layout by setting
    [`_pack_`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure._pack_ "ctypes.Structure._pack_") but not [`_layout_`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure._layout_ "ctypes.Structure._layout_")
    on non-Windows platforms.

## Pending removal in future versions

The following APIs will be removed in the future,
although there is currently no date scheduled for their removal.

- [`argparse`](../library/argparse.html#module-argparse "argparse: Command-line option and argument parsing library."):

  - Nesting argument groups and nesting mutually exclusive
    groups are deprecated.
  - Passing the undocumented keyword argument *prefix\_chars* to
    [`add_argument_group()`](../library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group "argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group") is now
    deprecated.
  - The [`argparse.FileType`](../library/argparse.html#argparse.FileType "argparse.FileType") type converter is deprecated.
- [`builtins`](../library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."):

  - Generators: `throw(type, exc, tb)` and `athrow(type, exc, tb)`
    signature is deprecated: use `throw(exc)` and `athrow(exc)` instead,
    the single argument signature.
  - Currently Python accepts numeric literals immediately followed by keywords,
    for example `0in x`, `1or x`, `0if 1else 2`. It allows confusing and
    ambiguous expressions like `[0x1for x in y]` (which can be interpreted as
    `[0x1 for x in y]` or `[0x1f or x in y]`). A syntax warning is raised
    if the numeric literal is immediately followed by one of keywords
    [`and`](../reference/expressions.html#and), [`else`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#else), [`for`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#for), [`if`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#if),
    [`in`](../reference/expressions.html#in), [`is`](../reference/expressions.html#is) and [`or`](../reference/expressions.html#or). In a future release it
    will be changed to a syntax error. ([gh-87999](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87999))
  - Support for `__index__()` and `__int__()` method returning non-int type:
    these methods will be required to return an instance of a strict subclass of
    [`int`](../library/functions.html#int "int").
  - Support for `__float__()` method returning a strict subclass of
    [`float`](../library/functions.html#float "float"): these methods will be required to return an instance of
    `float`.
  - Support for `__complex__()` method returning a strict subclass of
    [`complex`](../library/functions.html#complex "complex"): these methods will be required to return an instance of
    `complex`.
  - Passing a complex number as the *real* or *imag* argument in the
    [`complex()`](../library/functions.html#complex "complex") constructor is now deprecated; it should only be passed
    as a single positional argument.
    (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-109218](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109218).)
- [`calendar`](../library/calendar.html#module-calendar "calendar: Functions for working with calendars, including some emulation of the Unix cal program."): `calendar.January` and `calendar.February` constants are
  deprecated and replaced by [`calendar.JANUARY`](../library/calendar.html#calendar.JANUARY "calendar.JANUARY") and
  [`calendar.FEBRUARY`](../library/calendar.html#calendar.FEBRUARY "calendar.FEBRUARY").
  (Contributed by Prince Roshan in [gh-103636](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103636).)
- [`codecs`](../library/codecs.html#module-codecs "codecs: Encode and decode data and streams."): use [`open()`](../library/functions.html#open "open") instead of [`codecs.open()`](../library/codecs.html#codecs.open "codecs.open"). ([gh-133038](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133038))
- [`codeobject.co_lnotab`](../reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_lnotab "codeobject.co_lnotab"): use the [`codeobject.co_lines()`](../reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_lines "codeobject.co_lines") method
  instead.
- [`datetime`](../library/datetime.html#module-datetime "datetime: Basic date and time types."):

  - [`utcnow()`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.utcnow "datetime.datetime.utcnow"):
    use `datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.UTC)`.
  - [`utcfromtimestamp()`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp "datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp"):
    use `datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, tz=datetime.UTC)`.
- [`gettext`](../library/gettext.html#module-gettext "gettext: Multilingual internationalization services."): Plural value must be an integer.
- [`importlib`](../library/importlib.html#module-importlib "importlib: The implementation of the import machinery."):

  - [`cache_from_source()`](../library/importlib.html#importlib.util.cache_from_source "importlib.util.cache_from_source") *debug\_override* parameter is
    deprecated: use the *optimization* parameter instead.
- [`importlib.metadata`](../library/importlib.metadata.html#module-importlib.metadata "importlib.metadata: Accessing package metadata"):

  - `EntryPoints` tuple interface.
  - Implicit `None` on return values.
- [`logging`](../library/logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications."): the `warn()` method has been deprecated
  since Python 3.3, use [`warning()`](../library/logging.html#logging.warning "logging.warning") instead.
- [`mailbox`](../library/mailbox.html#module-mailbox "mailbox: Manipulate mailboxes in various formats"): Use of StringIO input and text mode is deprecated, use
  BytesIO and binary mode instead.
- [`os`](../library/os.html#module-os "os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces."): Calling [`os.register_at_fork()`](../library/os.html#os.register_at_fork "os.register_at_fork") in multi-threaded process.
- `pydoc.ErrorDuringImport`: A tuple value for *exc\_info* parameter is
  deprecated, use an exception instance.
- [`re`](../library/re.html#module-re "re: Regular expression operations."): More strict rules are now applied for numerical group references
  and group names in regular expressions. Only sequence of ASCII digits is now
  accepted as a numerical reference. The group name in bytes patterns and
  replacement strings can now only contain ASCII letters and digits and
  underscore.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-91760](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91760).)
- `sre_compile`, `sre_constants` and `sre_parse` modules.
- [`shutil`](../library/shutil.html#module-shutil "shutil: High-level file operations, including copying."): [`rmtree()`](../library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtree "shutil.rmtree")’s *onerror* parameter is deprecated in
  Python 3.12; use the *onexc* parameter instead.
- [`ssl`](../library/ssl.html#module-ssl "ssl: TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects") options and protocols:

  - [`ssl.SSLContext`](../library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext "ssl.SSLContext") without protocol argument is deprecated.
  - [`ssl.SSLContext`](../library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext "ssl.SSLContext"): [`set_npn_protocols()`](../library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.set_npn_protocols "ssl.SSLContext.set_npn_protocols") and

  - `threading.Condition.notifyAll()`: use [`notify_all()`](../library/threading.html#threading.Condition.notify_all "threading.Condition.notify_all").
  - `threading.Event.isSet()`: use [`is_set()`](../library/threading.html#threading.Event.is_set "threading.Event.is_set").
  - `threading.Thread.isDaemon()`, [`threading.Thread.setDaemon()`](../library/threading.html#threading.Thread.setDaemon "threading.Thread.setDaemon"):
    use [`threading.Thread.daemon`](../library/threading.html#threading.Thread.daemon "threading.Thread.daemon") attribute.
  - `threading.Thread.getName()`, [`threading.Thread.setName()`](../library/threading.html#threading.Thread.setName "threading.Thread.setName"):
