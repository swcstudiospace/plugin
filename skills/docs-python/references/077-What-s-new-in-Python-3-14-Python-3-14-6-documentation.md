## Summary – Release highlights

Python 3.14 is the latest stable release of the Python programming
language, with a mix of changes to the language, the implementation,
and the standard library.
The biggest changes include [template string literals](#whatsnew314-template-string-literals),
[deferred evaluation of annotations](#whatsnew314-deferred-annotations),
and support for [subinterpreters](#whatsnew314-multiple-interpreters) in
the standard library.

The library changes include significantly improved capabilities for
[introspection in asyncio](#whatsnew314-asyncio-introspection),
[support for Zstandard](#whatsnew314-zstandard) via a new
[`compression.zstd`](../library/compression.zstd.html#module-compression.zstd "compression.zstd: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines in the zstd library.") module, syntax highlighting in the REPL,
as well as the usual deprecations and removals,
and improvements in user-friendliness and correctness.

This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification
of all new features, but instead gives a convenient overview.
For full details refer to the documentation,
such as the [Library Reference](../library/index.html#library-index)
and [Language Reference](../reference/index.html#reference-index).
To understand the complete implementation and design rationale for a change,
refer to the PEP for a particular new feature;
but note that PEPs usually are not kept up-to-date
once a feature has been fully implemented.
See [Porting to Python 3.14](#porting-to-python-3-14) for guidance on upgrading from
earlier versions of Python.

## New features

### [**PEP 649**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/) & [**PEP 749**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0749/): Deferred evaluation of annotations

The [annotations](../glossary.html#term-annotation) on functions, classes, and modules are no
longer evaluated eagerly. Instead, annotations are stored in special-purpose
[annotate functions](../glossary.html#term-annotate-function) and evaluated only when
necessary (except if `from __future__ import annotations` is used).

This change is designed to improve performance and usability of annotations
in Python in most circumstances. The runtime cost for defining annotations is
minimized, but it remains possible to introspect annotations at runtime.
It is no longer necessary to enclose annotations in strings if they
contain forward references.

The new [`annotationlib`](../library/annotationlib.html#module-annotationlib "annotationlib: Functionality for introspecting annotations") module provides tools for inspecting deferred
annotations. Annotations may be evaluated in the [`VALUE`](../library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.VALUE "annotationlib.Format.VALUE")
format (which evaluates annotations to runtime values, similar to the behavior in
earlier Python versions), the [`FORWARDREF`](../library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF "annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF") format
(which replaces undefined names with special markers), and the
[`STRING`](../library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.STRING "annotationlib.Format.STRING") format (which returns annotations as strings).

This example shows how these formats behave:

```
>>> from annotationlib import get_annotations, Format
>>> def func(arg: Undefined):
...     pass
>>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.VALUE)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
NameError: name 'Undefined' is not defined
>>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.FORWARDREF)
{'arg': ForwardRef('Undefined', owner=<function func at 0x...>)}
>>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.STRING)
{'arg': 'Undefined'}
```

The [porting](#whatsnew314-porting-annotations) section contains guidance
on changes that may be needed due to these changes, though in the majority of
cases, code will continue working as-is.

### [**PEP 734**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0734/): Multiple interpreters in the standard library

The CPython runtime supports running multiple copies of Python in the
same process simultaneously and has done so for over 20 years.
Each of these separate copies is called an ‘interpreter’.
However, the feature had been available only through
the [C-API](../c-api/subinterpreters.html#sub-interpreter-support).

That limitation is removed in Python 3.14,
with the new [`concurrent.interpreters`](../library/concurrent.interpreters.html#module-concurrent.interpreters "concurrent.interpreters: Multiple interpreters in the same process") module.

There are at least two notable reasons why using multiple interpreters
has significant benefits:

- they support a new (to Python), human-friendly concurrency model
- true multi-core parallelism

For some use cases, concurrency in software improves efficiency and
can simplify design, at a high level.
At the same time, implementing and maintaining all but the simplest concurrency
is often a struggle for the human brain.
That especially applies to plain threads (for example, [`threading`](../library/threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.")),
where all memory is shared between all threads.

With multiple isolated interpreters, you can take advantage of a class
of concurrency models, like Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)
or the actor model, that have found
success in other programming languages, like Smalltalk, Erlang,
Haskell, and Go. Think of multiple interpreters as threads
but with opt-in sharing.

Regarding multi-core parallelism: as of Python 3.12, interpreters
are now sufficiently isolated from one another to be used in parallel
(see [**PEP 684**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/)). This unlocks a variety of CPU-intensive use cases
for Python that were limited by the [GIL](../glossary.html#term-GIL).

Using multiple interpreters is similar in many ways to
[`multiprocessing`](../library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism."), in that they both provide isolated logical
“processes” that can run in parallel, with no sharing by default.
However, when using multiple interpreters, an application will use
fewer system resources and will operate more efficiently (since it
stays within the same process). Think of multiple interpreters as
having the isolation of processes with the efficiency of threads.

While the feature has been around for decades, multiple interpreters
have not been used widely, due to low awareness and the lack of a
standard library module. Consequently, they currently have several
notable limitations, which are expected to improve significantly now
that the feature is going mainstream.

Current limitations:

- starting each interpreter has not been optimized yet
- each interpreter uses more memory than necessary
  (work continues on extensive internal sharing between interpreters)
- there aren’t many options *yet* for truly sharing objects or other
  data between interpreters (other than [`memoryview`](../library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview"))
- many third-party extension modules on PyPI are not yet compatible
  with multiple interpreters
  (all standard library extension modules *are* compatible)
- the approach to writing applications that use multiple isolated
  interpreters is mostly unfamiliar to Python users, for now

The impact of these limitations will depend on future CPython
improvements, how interpreters are used, and what the community solves
through PyPI packages. Depending on the use case, the limitations may
not have much impact, so try it out!

Furthermore, future CPython releases will reduce or eliminate overhead
and provide utilities that are less appropriate on PyPI. In the
meantime, most of the limitations can also be addressed through
extension modules, meaning PyPI packages can fill any gap for 3.14, and
even back to 3.12 where interpreters were finally properly isolated and
stopped sharing the [GIL](../glossary.html#term-GIL). Likewise, libraries on PyPI are expected
to emerge for high-level abstractions on top of interpreters.

Regarding extension modules, work is in progress to update some PyPI
projects, as well as tools like Cython, pybind11, nanobind, and PyO3.
The steps for isolating an extension module are found at
[Isolating Extension Modules](../howto/isolating-extensions.html#isolating-extensions-howto).
Isolating a module has a lot of overlap with what is required to support
[free-threading](#whatsnew314-free-threaded-cpython), so the ongoing
work in the community in that area will help accelerate support
for multiple interpreters.

Also added in 3.14: [concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor](#whatsnew314-concurrent-futures-interp-pool).

### [**PEP 750**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/): Template string literals

Template strings are a new mechanism for custom string processing.
They share the familiar syntax of f-strings but, unlike f-strings,
return an object representing the static and interpolated parts of
the string, instead of a simple [`str`](../library/stdtypes.html#str "str").

To write a t-string, use a `'t'` prefix instead of an `'f'`:

```
>>> variety = 'Stilton'
>>> template = t'Try some {variety} cheese!'
>>> type(template)
<class 'string.templatelib.Template'>
```

[`Template`](../library/string.templatelib.html#string.templatelib.Template "string.templatelib.Template") objects provide access to the static
and interpolated (in curly braces) parts of a string *before* they are combined.
Iterate over `Template` instances to access their parts in order:

```
>>> list(template)
['Try some ', Interpolation('Stilton', 'variety', None, ''), ' cheese!']
```

It’s easy to write (or call) code to process `Template` instances.
For example, here’s a function that renders static parts lowercase and
[`Interpolation`](../library/string.templatelib.html#string.templatelib.Interpolation "string.templatelib.Interpolation") instances uppercase:

```
from string.templatelib import Interpolation

def lower_upper(template):
    """Render static parts lowercase and interpolations uppercase."""
    parts = []
    for part in template:
        if isinstance(part, Interpolation):
            parts.append(str(part.value).upper())
        else:
            parts.append(part.lower())
    return ''.join(parts)

name = 'Wenslydale'
template = t'Mister {name}'
assert lower_upper(template) == 'mister WENSLYDALE'
```

Because `Template` instances distinguish between static strings and
interpolations at runtime, they can be useful for sanitising user input.
Writing a `html()` function that escapes user input in HTML is an exercise
left to the reader!
Template processing code can provide improved flexibility.
For instance, a more advanced `html()` function could accept
a `dict` of HTML attributes directly in the template:

```
attributes = {'src': 'limburger.jpg', 'alt': 'lovely cheese'}
template = t'<img {attributes}>'
assert html(template) == '<img src="limburger.jpg" alt="lovely cheese" />'
```

Of course, template processing code does not need to return a string-like result.
An even *more* advanced `html()` could return a custom type representing
a DOM-like structure.

With t-strings in place, developers can write systems that sanitise SQL,
make safe shell operations, improve logging, tackle modern ideas in web
development (HTML, CSS, and so on), and implement lightweight custom business DSLs.

### [**PEP 768**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0768/): Safe external debugger interface

Python 3.14 introduces a zero-overhead debugging interface that allows
debuggers and profilers to safely attach to running Python processes
without stopping or restarting them.
This is a significant enhancement to Python’s debugging capabilities,
meaning that unsafe alternatives are no longer required.

The new interface provides safe execution points for attaching debugger code
without modifying the interpreter’s normal execution path
or adding any overhead at runtime.
Due to this, tools can now inspect and interact with Python applications
in real-time, which is a crucial capability for high-availability systems
and production environments.

For convenience, this interface is implemented in the [`sys.remote_exec()`](../library/sys.html#sys.remote_exec "sys.remote_exec")
function. For example:

```
import sys
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile

with NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.py', delete=False) as f:
    script_path = f.name
    f.write(f'import my_debugger; my_debugger.connect({os.getpid()})')

# Execute in process with PID 1234
print('Behold! An offering:')
sys.remote_exec(1234, script_path)
```

This function allows sending Python code to be executed in a target process
at the next safe execution point.
However, tool authors can also implement the protocol directly as described
in the PEP, which details the underlying mechanisms used to safely attach to
running processes.

The debugging interface has been carefully designed with security in mind
and includes several mechanisms to control access:

- A [`PYTHON_DISABLE_REMOTE_DEBUG`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_DISABLE_REMOTE_DEBUG) environment variable.
- A [`-X disable-remote-debug`](../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X) command-line option.
- A [`--without-remote-debug`](../using/configure.html#cmdoption-without-remote-debug) configure flag to completely disable
  the feature at build time.

### A new type of interpreter

A new type of interpreter has been added to CPython.
It uses tail calls between small C functions that implement individual
Python opcodes, rather than one large C `case` statement.
For certain newer compilers, this interpreter provides
significantly better performance. Preliminary benchmarks suggest a geometric
mean of 3-5% faster on the standard `pyperformance` benchmark suite,
depending on platform and architecture.
The baseline is Python 3.14 built with Clang 19, without this new interpreter.

This interpreter currently only works with Clang 19 and newer
on x86-64 and AArch64 architectures.
However, a future release of GCC is expected to support this as well.

This feature is opt-in for now. Enabling profile-guided optimization is highly
recommended when using the new interpreter as it is the only configuration
that has been tested and validated for improved performance.
For further information, see [`--with-tail-call-interp`](../using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-tail-call-interp).

Note

This is not to be confused with [tail call optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) of Python
functions, which is currently not implemented in CPython.

This new interpreter type is an internal implementation detail of the CPython
interpreter. It doesn’t change the visible behavior of Python programs at
all. It can improve their performance, but doesn’t change anything else.

(Contributed by Ken Jin in [gh-128563](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128563), with ideas on how to implement this
in CPython by Mark Shannon, Garrett Gu, Haoran Xu, and Josh Haberman.)

### Free-threaded mode improvements

CPython’s free-threaded mode ([**PEP 703**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/)), initially added in 3.13,
has been significantly improved in Python 3.14.
The implementation described in PEP 703 has been finished, including C API
changes, and temporary workarounds in the interpreter were replaced with
more permanent solutions.
The specializing adaptive interpreter ([**PEP 659**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/)) is now enabled
in free-threaded mode, which along with many other optimizations
greatly improves its performance.
The performance penalty on single-threaded code in free-threaded mode
is now roughly 5-10%, depending on the platform and C compiler used.

From Python 3.14, when compiling extension modules for the free-threaded build of
CPython on Windows, the preprocessor variable `Py_GIL_DISABLED` now needs to
be specified by the build backend, as it will no longer be determined
automatically by the C compiler. For a running interpreter, the setting that
was used at compile time can be found using [`sysconfig.get_config_var()`](../library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.get_config_var "sysconfig.get_config_var").

The new [`-X context_aware_warnings`](../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X) flag controls if
[concurrent safe warnings control](#whatsnew314-concurrent-warnings-control)
is enabled. The flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build
and false for the GIL-enabled build.

A new [`thread_inherit_context`](../library/sys.html#sys.flags.thread_inherit_context "sys.flags.thread_inherit_context") flag has been added,
which if enabled means that threads created with [`threading.Thread`](../library/threading.html#threading.Thread "threading.Thread")
start with a copy of the [`Context()`](../library/contextvars.html#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context") of the caller of
[`start()`](../library/threading.html#threading.Thread.start "threading.Thread.start"). Most significantly, this makes the warning
filtering context established by [`catch_warnings`](../library/warnings.html#warnings.catch_warnings "warnings.catch_warnings") be
“inherited” by threads (or asyncio tasks) started within that context. It also
affects other modules that use context variables, such as the [`decimal`](../library/decimal.html#module-decimal "decimal: Implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification.")
context manager.
This flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build and false for
the GIL-enabled build.

significant engineering resources to support this project.)

### Improved error messages

- The interpreter now provides helpful suggestions when it detects typos in Python
  keywords. When a word that closely resembles a Python keyword is encountered,
  the interpreter will suggest the correct keyword in the error message. This
  feature helps programmers quickly identify and fix common typing mistakes. For
  example:

  ```
  >>> whille True:
  ...     pass
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1
      whille True:
      ^^^^^^
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Did you mean 'while'?
  ```

  While the feature focuses on the most common cases, some variations of
  misspellings may still result in regular syntax errors.
  (Contributed by Pablo Galindo in [gh-132449](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132449).)
- [`elif`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#elif) statements that follow an [`else`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#else) block now have
  a specific error message.
  (Contributed by Steele Farnsworth in [gh-129902](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129902).)

  ```
  >>> if who == "me":
  ...     print("It's me!")
  ... else:
  ...     print("It's not me!")
  ... elif who is None:
  ...     print("Who is it?")
  File "<stdin>", line 5
    elif who is None:
    ^^^^
  SyntaxError: 'elif' block follows an 'else' block
  ```
- If a statement is passed to the [Conditional expressions](../reference/expressions.html#if-expr) after [`else`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#else),
  or one of [`pass`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#pass), [`break`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#break), or [`continue`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#continue)
  is passed before [`if`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#if), then the
  error message highlights where the [`expression`](../reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) is
  required. (Contributed by Sergey Miryanov in [gh-129515](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129515).)

  ```
  >>> x = 1 if True else pass
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<string>", line 1
      x = 1 if True else pass
                         ^^^^
  SyntaxError: expected expression after 'else', but statement is given

  >>> x = continue if True else break
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<string>", line 1
      x = continue if True else break
          ^^^^^^^^
  SyntaxError: expected expression before 'if', but statement is given
  ```
- When incorrectly closed strings are detected, the error message suggests
  that the string may be intended to be part of the string.
  (Contributed by Pablo Galindo in [gh-88535](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88535).)

  ```
  >>> "The interesting object "The important object" is very important"
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Is this intended to be part of the string?
  ```
- When strings have incompatible prefixes, the error now shows
  which prefixes are incompatible.
  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in [gh-133197](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133197).)

  ```
  >>> ub'abc'
    File "<python-input-0>", line 1
      ub'abc'
      ^^
  SyntaxError: 'u' and 'b' prefixes are incompatible
  ```
- Improved error messages when using `as` with incompatible targets in:

  - Imports: `import ... as ...`
  - From imports: `from ... import ... as ...`
  - Except handlers: `except ... as ...`
  - Pattern-match cases: `case ... as ...`

- Improved error message when trying to add an instance of an unhashable type to
  a [`dict`](../library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") or [`set`](../library/stdtypes.html#set "set").
  (Contributed by CF Bolz-Tereick and Victor Stinner in [gh-132828](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132828).)

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<python-input-1>", line 1, in <module>
      s.add({'pages': 12, 'grade': 'A'})
      ~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  TypeError: cannot use 'dict' as a set element (unhashable type: 'dict')
  >>> d = {}
  >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
  >>> d[l] = 12
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<python-input-4>", line 1, in <module>
      d[l] = 12
      ~^^^
  TypeError: cannot use 'list' as a dict key (unhashable type: 'list')
  ```
- Improved error message when an object supporting the synchronous
  context manager protocol is entered using [`async with`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with)
  instead of [`with`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#with),
  and vice versa for the asynchronous context manager protocol.

### [**PEP 784**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0784/): Zstandard support in the standard library

The new `compression` package contains modules `compression.lzma`,
`compression.bz2`, `compression.gzip` and `compression.zlib`
which re-export the [`lzma`](../library/lzma.html#module-lzma "lzma: A Python wrapper for the liblzma compression library."), [`bz2`](../library/bz2.html#module-bz2 "bz2: Interfaces for bzip2 compression and decompression."), [`gzip`](../library/gzip.html#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.") and [`zlib`](../library/zlib.html#module-zlib "zlib: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines compatible with gzip.")
modules respectively. The new import names under `compression` are the
preferred names for importing these compression modules from Python 3.14. However,
the existing modules names have not been deprecated. Any deprecation or removal
of the existing compression modules will occur no sooner than five years after
the release of 3.14.

The new `compression.zstd` module provides compression and decompression
APIs for the Zstandard format via bindings to [Meta’s zstd library](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/). Zstandard is a widely adopted, highly
efficient, and fast compression format. In addition to the APIs introduced in
`compression.zstd`, support for reading and writing Zstandard compressed
archives has been added to the [`tarfile`](../library/tarfile.html#module-tarfile "tarfile: Read and write tar-format archive files."), [`zipfile`](../library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile "zipfile: Read and write ZIP-format archive files."), and
[`shutil`](../library/shutil.html#module-shutil "shutil: High-level file operations, including copying.") modules.

Here’s an example of using the new module to compress some data:

```
from compression import zstd
import math

data = str(math.pi).encode() * 20
compressed = zstd.compress(data)
ratio = len(compressed) / len(data)
print(f"Achieved compression ratio of {ratio}")
```

As can be seen, the API is similar to the APIs of the `lzma` and
`bz2` modules.

### Asyncio introspection capabilities

Added a new command-line interface to inspect running Python processes
using asynchronous tasks, available via `python -m asyncio ps PID`
or `python -m asyncio pstree PID`.

The `ps` subcommand inspects the given process ID (PID) and displays
information about currently running asyncio tasks.
It outputs a task table: a flat listing of all tasks, their names,
their coroutine stacks, and which tasks are awaiting them.

The `pstree` subcommand fetches the same information, but instead renders a
visual async call tree, showing coroutine relationships in a hierarchical format.
This command is particularly useful for debugging long-running or stuck
asynchronous programs.
It can help developers quickly identify where a program is blocked,
what tasks are pending, and how coroutines are chained together.

For example given this code:

```
import asyncio

async def play_track(track):
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    print(f'🎵 Finished: {track}')

async def play_album(name, tracks):
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        for track in tracks:
            tg.create_task(play_track(track), name=track)

async def main():
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        tg.create_task(
          play_album('Sundowning', ['TNDNBTG', 'Levitate']),
          name='Sundowning')
        tg.create_task(
          play_album('TMBTE', ['DYWTYLM', 'Aqua Regia']),
          name='TMBTE')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Executing the new tool on the running process will yield a table like this:

```
python -m asyncio ps 12345

tid        task id              task name            coroutine stack                                    awaiter chain                                      awaiter name    awaiter id

If a cycle is detected in the async await graph (which could indicate a
programming issue), the tool raises an error and lists the cycle paths that
prevent tree construction:

```
python -m asyncio pstree 12345

ERROR: await-graph contains cycles - cannot print a tree!

cycle: Task-2 → Task-3 → Task-2
```

### Concurrent safe warnings control

The [`warnings.catch_warnings`](../library/warnings.html#warnings.catch_warnings "warnings.catch_warnings") context manager will now optionally
use a context variable for warning filters. This is enabled by setting
the [`context_aware_warnings`](../library/sys.html#sys.flags.context_aware_warnings "sys.flags.context_aware_warnings") flag, either with the `-X`
command-line option or an environment variable. This gives predictable
warnings control when using `catch_warnings` combined with
multiple threads or asynchronous tasks. The flag defaults to true for the
free-threaded build and false for the GIL-enabled build.

## Other language changes

- All Windows code pages are now supported as ‘cpXXX’ codecs on Windows.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-123803](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123803).)
- Implement mixed-mode arithmetic rules combining real and complex numbers
  as specified by the C standard since C99.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-69639](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/69639).)
- More syntax errors are now detected regardless of optimisation and
  the [`-O`](../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-O) command-line option.
  This includes writes to `__debug__`, incorrect use of [`await`](../reference/expressions.html#await),
  and asynchronous comprehensions outside asynchronous functions.
  For example, `python -O -c 'assert (__debug__ := 1)'`
  or `python -O -c 'assert await 1'` now produce [`SyntaxError`](../library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError")s.
  (Contributed by Irit Katriel and Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-122245](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122245) & [gh-121637](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121637).)
- When subclassing a pure C type, the C slots for the new type
  are no longer replaced with a wrapped version on class creation
  if they are not explicitly overridden in the subclass.

### Built-ins

- The [`bytes.fromhex()`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytes.fromhex "bytes.fromhex") and [`bytearray.fromhex()`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytearray.fromhex "bytearray.fromhex") methods now accept
  ASCII [`bytes`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [bytes-like objects](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object).
  (Contributed by Daniel Pope in [gh-129349](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129349).)
- Add class methods [`float.from_number()`](../library/stdtypes.html#float.from_number "float.from_number") and [`complex.from_number()`](../library/stdtypes.html#complex.from_number "complex.from_number")
  to convert a number to [`float`](../library/functions.html#float "float") or [`complex`](../library/functions.html#complex "complex") type correspondingly.
  They raise a [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") if the argument is not a real number.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-84978](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84978).)
- Support underscore and comma as thousands separators in the fractional part
  for floating-point presentation types of the new-style string formatting
  (with [`format()`](../library/functions.html#format "format") or [f-strings](../reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings)).
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-87790](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87790).)
- The [`int()`](../library/functions.html#int "int") function no longer delegates to [`__trunc__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__trunc__ "object.__trunc__").
  Classes that want to support conversion to `int()` must implement
  either [`__int__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__int__ "object.__int__") or [`__index__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__index__ "object.__index__").
  (Contributed by Mark Dickinson in [gh-119743](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119743).)
- The [`map()`](../library/functions.html#map "map") function now has an optional keyword-only *strict* flag
  like [`zip()`](../library/functions.html#zip "zip") to check that all the iterables are of equal length.
  (Contributed by Wannes Boeykens in [gh-119793](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119793).)
- The [`memoryview`](../library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") type now supports subscription,
  making it a [generic type](../glossary.html#term-generic-type).
  (Contributed by Brian Schubert in [gh-126012](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126012).)
- Using [`NotImplemented`](../library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented") in a boolean context
  will now raise a [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").
  This has raised a [`DeprecationWarning`](../library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") since Python 3.9.
  (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-118767](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118767).)
- Three-argument [`pow()`](../library/functions.html#pow "pow") now tries calling [`__rpow__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__rpow__ "object.__rpow__")
  if necessary.
  Previously it was only called in two-argument `pow()`
  and the binary power operator.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-130104](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130104).)
- [`super`](../library/functions.html#super "super") objects are now [`copyable`](../library/copy.html#module-copy "copy: Shallow and deep copy operations.") and [`pickleable`](../library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.").
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-125767](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125767).)

### Command line and environment

- The import time flag can now track modules that are already loaded (‘cached’),
  via the new [`-X importtime=2`](../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X).
  When such a module is imported, the `self` and `cumulative` times
  are replaced by the string `cached`.

  Values above `2` for `-X importtime` are now reserved for future use.

  (Contributed by Noah Kim and Adam Turner in [gh-118655](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118655).)
- The command-line option [`-c`](../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) now automatically dedents its code
  argument before execution. The auto-dedentation behavior mirrors
  [`textwrap.dedent()`](../library/textwrap.html#textwrap.dedent "textwrap.dedent").
  (Contributed by Jon Crall and Steven Sun in [gh-103998](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103998).)
- `-J` is no longer a reserved flag for [Jython](https://www.jython.org/),
  and now has no special meaning.
  (Contributed by Adam Turner in [gh-133336](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133336).)

### PEP 758: Allow `except` and `except*` expressions without brackets

The [`except`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#except) and [`except*`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#except-star) expressions
now allow brackets to be omitted when there are multiple exception types
and the `as` clause is not used.
For example:

```
try:
    connect_to_server()
except TimeoutError, ConnectionRefusedError:
    print('The network has ceased to be!')
```

(Contributed by Pablo Galindo and Brett Cannon in [**PEP 758**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0758/) and [gh-131831](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131831).)

### PEP 765: Control flow in [`finally`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) blocks

The compiler now emits a [`SyntaxWarning`](../library/exceptions.html#SyntaxWarning "SyntaxWarning") when a [`return`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#return),
[`break`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#break), or [`continue`](../reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) statement have the effect of
leaving a [`finally`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) block.
This change is specified in [**PEP 765**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0765/).

In situations where this change is inconvenient (such as those where the
warnings are redundant due to code linting), the [warning filter](../library/warnings.html#warning-filter) can be used to turn off all syntax warnings by adding
`ignore::SyntaxWarning` as a filter. This can be specified in combination
with a filter that converts other warnings to errors (for example, passing
`-Werror -Wignore::SyntaxWarning` as CLI options, or setting
`PYTHONWARNINGS=error,ignore::SyntaxWarning`).

Note that applying such a filter at runtime using the [`warnings`](../library/warnings.html#module-warnings "warnings: Issue warning messages and control their disposition.") module
will only suppress the warning in code that is compiled *after* the filter is
adjusted. Code that is compiled prior to the filter adjustment (for example,
when a module is imported) will still emit the syntax warning.

### Garbage collection

**From Python 3.14.5 onwards:**

The garbage collector (GC) has changed in Python 3.14.5.

Python 3.14.0-3.14.4 shipped with a new incremental GC.
However, due to a number of [reports](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/142516)
of significant memory pressure in production environments,
it has been reverted back to the generational GC from 3.13.
This is the GC now used in Python 3.14.5 and later.

**Previously in Python 3.14.0-3.14.4:**

The cycle garbage collector is now incremental.
This means that maximum pause times are reduced
by an order of magnitude or more for larger heaps.

There are now only two generations: young and old.
When [`gc.collect()`](../library/gc.html#gc.collect "gc.collect") is not called directly, the
GC is invoked a little less frequently. When invoked, it
collects the young generation and an increment of the
old generation, instead of collecting one or more generations.

The behavior of `gc.collect()` changes slightly:

- `gc.collect(1)`: Performs an increment of garbage collection,
  rather than collecting generation 1.
- Other calls to `gc.collect()` are unchanged.

(Contributed by Mark Shannon in [gh-108362](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108362).)

### Default interactive shell

- The default [interactive](../glossary.html#term-interactive) shell now highlights Python syntax.
  The feature is enabled by default, save if [`PYTHON_BASIC_REPL`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_BASIC_REPL)
  or any other environment variable that disables colour is set.
  See [Controlling color](../using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color) for details.

  The default color theme for syntax highlighting strives for good contrast
  and exclusively uses the 4-bit VGA standard ANSI color codes for maximum
  compatibility. The theme can be customized using an experimental API
  `_colorize.set_theme()`.
  This can be called interactively or in the [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) script.
  Note that this function has no stability guarantees,
  and may change or be removed.

  (Contributed by Łukasz Langa in [gh-131507](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131507).)
- The default [interactive](../glossary.html#term-interactive) shell now supports import auto-completion.
  This means that typing `import co` and pressing `<Tab>` will suggest
  modules starting with `co`. Similarly, typing `from concurrent import i`
  will suggest submodules of `concurrent` starting with `i`.
  Note that autocompletion of module attributes is not currently supported.

## Improved modules

### argparse

- The default value of the [program name](../library/argparse.html#prog) for
  [`argparse.ArgumentParser`](../library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser "argparse.ArgumentParser") now reflects the way the Python
  interpreter was instructed to find the `__main__` module code.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka and Alyssa Coghlan in [gh-66436](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/66436).)
- Introduced the optional *suggest\_on\_error* parameter to
  [`argparse.ArgumentParser`](../library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser "argparse.ArgumentParser"), enabling suggestions for argument choices
  and subparser names if mistyped by the user.
  (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in [gh-124456](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124456).)
- Enable color for help text, which can be disabled with the optional *color*
  parameter to [`argparse.ArgumentParser`](../library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser "argparse.ArgumentParser").
  This can also be controlled by [environment variables](../using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color).
  (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-130645](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130645).)

### ast

- Add [`compare()`](../library/ast.html#ast.compare "ast.compare"), a function for comparing two ASTs.
  (Contributed by Batuhan Taskaya and Jeremy Hylton in [gh-60191](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/60191).)
- Add support for [`copy.replace()`](../library/copy.html#copy.replace "copy.replace") for AST nodes.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-121141](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121141).)
- Docstrings are now removed from an optimized AST in optimization level 2.
  (Contributed by Irit Katriel in [gh-123958](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123958).)
- The [`repr()`](../library/functions.html#repr "repr") output for AST nodes now includes more information.
  (Contributed by Tomas Roun in [gh-116022](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116022).)
- When called with an AST as input, the [`parse()`](../library/ast.html#ast.parse "ast.parse") function
  now always verifies that the root node type is appropriate.
  (Contributed by Irit Katriel in [gh-130139](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130139).)
- Add new options to the command-line interface:
  [`--feature-version`](../library/ast.html#cmdoption-ast-feature-version),
  [`--optimize`](../library/ast.html#cmdoption-ast-optimize), and
  [`--show-empty`](../library/ast.html#cmdoption-ast-show-empty).
  (Contributed by Semyon Moroz in [gh-133367](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133367).)

### asyncio

- The function and methods named `create_task()` now take an arbitrary
  list of keyword arguments. All keyword arguments are passed to the
  [`Task`](../library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") constructor or the custom task factory.
  (See [`set_task_factory()`](../library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.set_task_factory "asyncio.loop.set_task_factory") for details.)
  The `name` and `context` keyword arguments are no longer special;
  the name should now be set using the `name` keyword argument of the factory,
  and `context` may be `None`.

  This affects the following function and methods:
  [`asyncio.create_task()`](../library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.create_task "asyncio.create_task"),
  [`asyncio.loop.create_task()`](../library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.create_task "asyncio.loop.create_task"),

### calendar

- By default, today’s date is highlighted in color in [`calendar`](../library/calendar.html#module-calendar "calendar: Functions for working with calendars, including some emulation of the Unix cal program.")’s
  [command-line](../library/calendar.html#calendar-cli) text output.
  This can be controlled by [environment variables](../using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color).
  (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-128317](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128317).)

### concurrent.futures

- Add a new executor class, [`InterpreterPoolExecutor`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor"),
  which exposes multiple Python interpreters in the same process
  (‘subinterpreters’) to Python code.
  This uses a pool of independent Python interpreters to execute calls
  asynchronously.

  This is separate from the new [`interpreters`](../library/concurrent.interpreters.html#module-concurrent.interpreters "concurrent.interpreters: Multiple interpreters in the same process") module
  introduced by [PEP 734](#whatsnew314-multiple-interpreters).
  (Contributed by Eric Snow in [gh-124548](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124548).)

- On Unix platforms other than macOS, [‘forkserver’](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-forkserver) is now the default [start
  method](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-methods) for
  [`ProcessPoolExecutor`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor")
  (replacing [‘fork’](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-fork)).
  This change does not affect Windows or macOS, where [‘spawn’](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-spawn) remains the default start method.

  If the threading incompatible *fork* method is required, you must explicitly
  request it by supplying a multiprocessing context *mp\_context* to
  [`ProcessPoolExecutor`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor").

  See [forkserver restrictions](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming-forkserver)
  for information and differences with the *fork* method and how this change
  may affect existing code with mutable global shared variables and/or shared
  objects that can not be automatically [`pickled`](../library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.").

  (Contributed by Gregory P. Smith in [gh-84559](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84559).)
- Add two new methods to [`ProcessPoolExecutor`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor"),
  [`terminate_workers()`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.terminate_workers "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.terminate_workers")
  and [`kill_workers()`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.kill_workers "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.kill_workers"),
  as ways to terminate or kill all living worker processes in the given pool.
  (Contributed by Charles Machalow in [gh-130849](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130849).)
- Add the optional *buffersize* parameter to [`Executor.map`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor.map "concurrent.futures.Executor.map") to limit the number of submitted
  tasks whose results have not yet been yielded. If the buffer is full,
  iteration over the *iterables* pauses until a result is yielded from the
  buffer.
  (Contributed by Enzo Bonnal and Josh Rosenberg in [gh-74028](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74028).)

### configparser

- `configparser` will no longer write config files it cannot read,
  to improve security.
  Attempting to [`write()`](../library/configparser.html#configparser.ConfigParser.write "configparser.ConfigParser.write") keys containing
  delimiters or beginning with the section header pattern will raise an
  [`InvalidWriteError`](../library/configparser.html#configparser.InvalidWriteError "configparser.InvalidWriteError").
  (Contributed by Jacob Lincoln in [gh-129270](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129270).)

  in [`Structure`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure "ctypes.Structure") and [`Union`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Union "ctypes.Union") objects
  is now a closer match to platform defaults (GCC/Clang or MSVC).
  In particular, fields no longer overlap.
  (Contributed by Matthias Görgens in [gh-97702](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97702).)
- The [`Structure._layout_`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure._layout_ "ctypes.Structure._layout_") class attribute can now be set
  to help match a non-default ABI.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in [gh-97702](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97702).)
- The class of [`Structure`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure "ctypes.Structure")/[`Union`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Union "ctypes.Union")
  field descriptors is now available as [`CField`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.CField "ctypes.CField"),
  and has new attributes to aid debugging and introspection.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in [gh-128715](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128715).)
- On Windows, the [`COMError`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.COMError "ctypes.COMError") exception is now public.

- Add [`memoryview_at()`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.memoryview_at "ctypes.memoryview_at"), a function to create a
  [`memoryview`](../library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") object that refers to the supplied pointer and
  length. This works like [`ctypes.string_at()`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.string_at "ctypes.string_at") except it avoids a
  buffer copy, and is typically useful when implementing pure Python
  callback functions that are passed dynamically-sized buffers.
  (Contributed by Rian Hunter in [gh-112018](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112018).)
- Complex types, [`c_float_complex`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_float_complex "ctypes.c_float_complex"),
  [`c_double_complex`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_double_complex "ctypes.c_double_complex"), and [`c_longdouble_complex`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_longdouble_complex "ctypes.c_longdouble_complex"),
  are now available if both the compiler and the `libffi` library support
  complex C types.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-61103](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/61103).)

- Move [`ctypes.POINTER()`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.POINTER "ctypes.POINTER") types cache from a global internal cache
  (`_pointer_type_cache`) to the [`_CData.__pointer_type__`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes._CData.__pointer_type__ "ctypes._CData.__pointer_type__") attribute of the corresponding
  `ctypes` types.
  This will stop the cache from growing without limits in some situations.
  (Contributed by Sergey Miryanov in [gh-100926](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100926).)
- The [`py_object`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.py_object "ctypes.py_object") type now supports subscription,
  making it a [generic type](../glossary.html#term-generic-type).
  (Contributed by Brian Schubert in [gh-132168](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132168).)
- `ctypes` now supports [free-threading builds](../glossary.html#term-free-threading).

  This is now preferred to **python -m json.tool**,
  which is [soft deprecated](../glossary.html#term-soft-deprecated).
  See the [JSON command-line interface](../library/json.html#json-commandline) documentation.
  (Contributed by Trey Hunner in [gh-122873](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122873).)

### multiprocessing

- On Unix platforms other than macOS, [‘forkserver’](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-forkserver) is now the default [start
  method](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-methods)
  (replacing [‘fork’](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-fork)).
  This change does not affect Windows or macOS, where [‘spawn’](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-spawn) remains the default start method.

  If the threading incompatible *fork* method is required, you must explicitly
  request it via a context from [`get_context()`](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.get_context "multiprocessing.get_context") (preferred)
  or change the default via [`set_start_method()`](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.set_start_method "multiprocessing.set_start_method").

  See [forkserver restrictions](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming-forkserver)
  for information and differences with the *fork* method and how this change
  may affect existing code with mutable global shared variables and/or shared
  objects that can not be automatically [`pickled`](../library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.").

- [`multiprocessing`](../library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.")’s `'forkserver'` start method now authenticates
  its control socket to avoid solely relying on filesystem permissions
  to restrict what other processes could cause the forkserver to spawn workers
  and run code.

- The [multiprocessing proxy objects](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-proxy-objects)
  for *list* and *dict* types gain previously overlooked missing methods:

  > - `clear()` and `copy()` for proxies of [`list`](../library/stdtypes.html#list "list")
  > - [`fromkeys()`](../library/stdtypes.html#dict.fromkeys "dict.fromkeys"), `reversed(d)`, `d | {}`, `{} | d`,
  >   `d |= {'b': 2}` for proxies of [`dict`](../library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict")

  (Contributed by Roy Hyunjin Han for [gh-103134](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103134).)
- Add support for shared [`set`](../library/stdtypes.html#set "set") objects via
  [`SyncManager.set()`](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.set "multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.set").
  The [`set()`](../library/stdtypes.html#set "set") in [`Manager()`](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Manager "multiprocessing.Manager") method is now available.
  (Contributed by Mingyu Park in [gh-129949](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129949).)
- Add the [`interrupt()`](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Process.interrupt "multiprocessing.Process.interrupt")
  to [`multiprocessing.Process`](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") objects, which terminates the child
  process by sending [`SIGINT`](../library/signal.html#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT"). This enables
  [`finally`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clauses to print a stack trace for the terminated
  process. (Contributed by Artem Pulkin in [gh-131913](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131913).)

### operator

- Add [`is_none()`](../library/operator.html#operator.is_none "operator.is_none") and [`is_not_none()`](../library/operator.html#operator.is_not_none "operator.is_not_none") as a pair
  of functions, such that `operator.is_none(obj)` is equivalent
  to `obj is None` and `operator.is_not_none(obj)` is equivalent
  to `obj is not None`.
  (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger and Nico Mexis in [gh-115808](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115808).)

### os

- Add the [`reload_environ()`](../library/os.html#os.reload_environ "os.reload_environ") function to update [`os.environ`](../library/os.html#os.environ "os.environ") and
  [`os.environb`](../library/os.html#os.environb "os.environb") with changes to the environment made by
  [`os.putenv()`](../library/os.html#os.putenv "os.putenv"), by [`os.unsetenv()`](../library/os.html#os.unsetenv "os.unsetenv"), or made outside Python in the
  same process.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-120057](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120057).)
- Add the [`SCHED_DEADLINE`](../library/os.html#os.SCHED_DEADLINE "os.SCHED_DEADLINE") and [`SCHED_NORMAL`](../library/os.html#os.SCHED_NORMAL "os.SCHED_NORMAL") constants
  to the `os` module.
  (Contributed by James Roy in [gh-127688](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127688).)
- Add the [`readinto()`](../library/os.html#os.readinto "os.readinto") function to read into a
  [buffer object](../c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) from a file descriptor.
  (Contributed by Cody Maloney in [gh-129205](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129205).)

### os.path

- The *strict* parameter to [`realpath()`](../library/os.path.html#os.path.realpath "os.path.realpath") accepts a new value,
  [`ALLOW_MISSING`](../library/os.path.html#os.path.ALLOW_MISSING "os.path.ALLOW_MISSING").
  If used, errors other than [`FileNotFoundError`](../library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError "FileNotFoundError") will be re-raised;
  the resulting path can be missing but it will be free of symlinks.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin for [**CVE 2025-4517**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4517).)

### pathlib

- Add methods to [`pathlib.Path`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path "pathlib.Path") to recursively copy or move files and
  directories:

  - [`copy()`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.copy "pathlib.Path.copy") copies a file or directory tree to a destination.
  - [`copy_into()`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.copy_into "pathlib.Path.copy_into") copies *into* a destination directory.
  - [`move()`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.move "pathlib.Path.move") moves a file or directory tree to a destination.
  - [`move_into()`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.move_into "pathlib.Path.move_into") moves *into* a destination directory.

  (Contributed by Barney Gale in [gh-73991](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/73991).)
- Add the [`info`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.info "pathlib.Path.info") attribute, which stores an object
  implementing the new [`pathlib.types.PathInfo`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.types.PathInfo "pathlib.types.PathInfo") protocol. The
  object supports querying the file type and internally caching
  [`stat()`](../library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat") results. Path objects generated by
  [`iterdir()`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.iterdir "pathlib.Path.iterdir") are initialized with file type information
  gleaned from scanning the parent directory.
  (Contributed by Barney Gale in [gh-125413](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125413).)

### pdb

- The [`pdb`](../library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") module now supports remote attaching to a running Python process
  using a new [`-p PID`](../library/pdb.html#cmdoption-pdb-p) command-line option:

  ```
  python -m pdb -p 1234
  ```

  This will connect to the Python process with the given PID and allow you to
  debug it interactively. Notice that due to how the Python interpreter works
  attaching to a remote process that is blocked in a system call or waiting for
  I/O will only work once the next bytecode instruction is executed or when the
  process receives a signal.

  This feature uses [PEP 768](#whatsnew314-remote-debugging)
  and the new [`sys.remote_exec()`](../library/sys.html#sys.remote_exec "sys.remote_exec") function to attach to the remote process
  and send the PDB commands to it.

  (Contributed by Matt Wozniski and Pablo Galindo in [gh-131591](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131591).)
- Hardcoded breakpoints ([`breakpoint()`](../library/functions.html#breakpoint "breakpoint") and [`set_trace()`](../library/pdb.html#pdb.set_trace "pdb.set_trace")) now
  reuse the most recent [`Pdb`](../library/pdb.html#pdb.Pdb "pdb.Pdb") instance that calls
  [`set_trace()`](../library/pdb.html#pdb.Pdb.set_trace "pdb.Pdb.set_trace"), instead of creating a new one each time.
  As a result, all the instance specific data like [`display`](../library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-display) and
  [`commands`](../library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-commands) are preserved across hardcoded breakpoints.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-121450](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121450).)
- Add a new argument *mode* to [`pdb.Pdb`](../library/pdb.html#pdb.Pdb "pdb.Pdb"). Disable the `restart`
  command when [`pdb`](../library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") is in `inline` mode.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-123757](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123757).)
- A confirmation prompt will be shown when the user tries to quit [`pdb`](../library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.")
  in `inline` mode. `y`, `Y`, `<Enter>` or `EOF` will confirm
  the quit and call [`sys.exit()`](../library/sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit"), instead of raising [`bdb.BdbQuit`](../library/bdb.html#bdb.BdbQuit "bdb.BdbQuit").
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-124704](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124704).)
- Inline breakpoints like [`breakpoint()`](../library/functions.html#breakpoint "breakpoint") or [`pdb.set_trace()`](../library/pdb.html#pdb.set_trace "pdb.set_trace") will
  always stop the program at calling frame, ignoring the `skip` pattern
  (if any).
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-130493](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130493).)
- `<tab>` at the beginning of the line in [`pdb`](../library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") multi-line input will
  fill in a 4-space indentation now, instead of inserting a `\t` character.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-130471](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130471).)
- Auto-indent is introduced in [`pdb`](../library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") multi-line input. It will either
  keep the indentation of the last line or insert a 4-space indentation when
  it detects a new code block.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-133350](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133350).)
- `$_asynctask` is added to access the current asyncio task if applicable.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-124367](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124367).)
- [`pdb.set_trace_async()`](../library/pdb.html#pdb.set_trace_async "pdb.set_trace_async") is added to support debugging asyncio
  coroutines. [`await`](../reference/expressions.html#await) statements are supported with this
  function.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-132576](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132576).)
- Source code displayed in [`pdb`](../library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") will be syntax-highlighted. This feature
  can be controlled using the same methods as the default [interactive](../glossary.html#term-interactive)

### re

- Support `\z` as a synonym for `\Z` in [`regular expressions`](../library/re.html#module-re "re: Regular expression operations.").
  It is interpreted unambiguously in many other regular expression engines,
  unlike `\Z`, which has subtly different behavior.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-133306](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133306).)
- `\B` in [`regular expression`](../library/re.html#module-re "re: Regular expression operations.") now matches the empty input string,
  meaning that it is now always the opposite of `\b`.

### types

- [`types.UnionType`](../library/types.html#types.UnionType "types.UnionType") is now an alias for [`typing.Union`](../library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union").
  See [below](#whatsnew314-typing-union) for more details.
  (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-105499](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105499).)

### typing

- The [`types.UnionType`](../library/types.html#types.UnionType "types.UnionType") and [`typing.Union`](../library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union") types are now
  aliases for each other, meaning that both old-style unions
  (created with `Union[int, str]`) and new-style unions (`int | str`)
  now create instances of the same runtime type. This unifies the behavior
  between the two syntaxes, but leads to some differences in behavior that
  may affect users who introspect types at runtime:

  - Both syntaxes for creating a union now produce the same string
    representation in [`repr()`](../library/functions.html#repr "repr").
    For example, `repr(Union[int, str])` is now `"int | str"` instead of
    `"typing.Union[int, str]"`.
  - Unions created using the old syntax are no longer cached.
    Previously, running `Union[int, str]` multiple times would return
    the same object (`Union[int, str] is Union[int, str]` would be `True`),
    but now it will return two different objects.
    Use `==` to compare unions for equality, not `is`.
    New-style unions have never been cached this way.
    This change could increase memory usage for some programs that use
    a large number of unions created by subscripting `typing.Union`.
    However, several factors offset this cost:
    unions used in annotations are no longer evaluated by default in Python
    3.14 because of [**PEP 649**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/); an instance of [`types.UnionType`](../library/types.html#types.UnionType "types.UnionType") is
    itself much smaller than the object returned by `Union[]` was on prior
    Python versions; and removing the cache also saves some space.
    It is therefore unlikely that this change will cause a significant increase
    in memory usage for most users.
  - Previously, old-style unions were implemented using the private class
    `typing._UnionGenericAlias`.
    This class is no longer needed for the implementation,
    but it has been retained for backward compatibility,
    with removal scheduled for Python 3.17.
    Users should use documented introspection helpers like
    [`get_origin()`](../library/typing.html#typing.get_origin "typing.get_origin") and [`typing.get_args()`](../library/typing.html#typing.get_args "typing.get_args") instead of
    relying on private implementation details.
  - It is now possible to use [`typing.Union`](../library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union") itself in
    [`isinstance()`](../library/functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") checks.
    For example, `isinstance(int | str, typing.Union)` will return `True`;
    previously this raised [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").
  - The `__args__` attribute of [`typing.Union`](../library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union") objects is
    no longer writable.
  - It is no longer possible to set any attributes on [`Union`](../library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union")
    objects.
    This only ever worked for dunder attributes on previous versions, was never
    documented to work, and was subtly broken in many cases.

- [`TypeAliasType`](../library/typing.html#typing.TypeAliasType "typing.TypeAliasType") now supports star unpacking.

### unicodedata

- The Unicode database has been updated to Unicode 16.0.0.

### unittest

- [`unittest`](../library/unittest.html#module-unittest "unittest: Unit testing framework for Python.") output is now colored by default.
  This can be controlled by [environment variables](../using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color).
  (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-127221](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127221).)
- unittest discovery supports [namespace package](../glossary.html#term-namespace-package) as start
  directory again. It was removed in Python 3.11.
  (Contributed by Jacob Walls in [gh-80958](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/80958).)
- A number of new methods were added in the [`TestCase`](../library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") class
  that provide more specialized tests.

  - [`assertHasAttr()`](../library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertHasAttr "unittest.TestCase.assertHasAttr") and
    [`assertNotHasAttr()`](../library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertNotHasAttr "unittest.TestCase.assertNotHasAttr") check whether the object
    has a particular attribute.
  - [`assertIsSubclass()`](../library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertIsSubclass "unittest.TestCase.assertIsSubclass") and
    [`assertNotIsSubclass()`](../library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertNotIsSubclass "unittest.TestCase.assertNotIsSubclass") check whether the object
    is a subclass of a particular class, or of one of a tuple of classes.
  - [`assertStartsWith()`](../library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertStartsWith "unittest.TestCase.assertStartsWith"),
    [`assertNotStartsWith()`](../library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertNotStartsWith "unittest.TestCase.assertNotStartsWith"),
    [`assertEndsWith()`](../library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertEndsWith "unittest.TestCase.assertEndsWith") and
    [`assertNotEndsWith()`](../library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertNotEndsWith "unittest.TestCase.assertNotEndsWith") check whether the Unicode
    or byte string starts or ends with particular strings.

### urllib

- Upgrade HTTP digest authentication algorithm for [`urllib.request`](../library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request "urllib.request: Extensible library for opening URLs.") by
  supporting SHA-256 digest authentication as specified in [**RFC 7616**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7616.html).
  (Contributed by Calvin Bui in [gh-128193](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128193).)
- Improve ergonomics and standards compliance when parsing and emitting
  `file:` URLs.

  In [`url2pathname()`](../library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.url2pathname "urllib.request.url2pathname"):

  - Accept a complete URL when the new *require\_scheme* argument is set to
    true.
  - Discard URL authority if it matches the local hostname.
  - Discard URL authority if it resolves to a local IP address when the new
    *resolve\_host* argument is set to true.
  - Discard URL query and fragment components.
  - Raise [`URLError`](../library/urllib.error.html#urllib.error.URLError "urllib.error.URLError") if a URL authority isn’t local,
    except on Windows where we return a UNC path as before.

  In [`pathname2url()`](../library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.pathname2url "urllib.request.pathname2url"):

  - Return a complete URL when the new *add\_scheme* argument is set to true.
  - Include an empty URL authority when a path begins with a slash. For
    example, the path `/etc/hosts` is converted to the URL `///etc/hosts`.

  On Windows, drive letters are no longer converted to uppercase, and `:`
  characters not following a drive letter no longer cause an [`OSError`](../library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError")
  exception to be raised.

### uuid

- Add support for UUID versions 6, 7, and 8 via [`uuid6()`](../library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid6 "uuid.uuid6"),
  [`uuid7()`](../library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid7 "uuid.uuid7"), and [`uuid8()`](../library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid8 "uuid.uuid8") respectively, as specified
  in [**RFC 9562**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9562.html).
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-89083](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89083).)
- [`NIL`](../library/uuid.html#uuid.NIL "uuid.NIL") and [`MAX`](../library/uuid.html#uuid.MAX "uuid.MAX") are now available to represent the
  Nil and Max UUID formats as defined by [**RFC 9562**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9562.html).
  (Contributed by Nick Pope in [gh-128427](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128427).)
- Allow generating multiple UUIDs simultaneously on the command-line via
  [`python -m uuid --count`](../library/uuid.html#cmdoption-uuid-count).
  (Contributed by Simon Legner in [gh-131236](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131236).)

### webbrowser

- Names in the `BROWSER` environment variable can now refer to already
  registered browsers for the [`webbrowser`](../library/webbrowser.html#module-webbrowser "webbrowser: Easy-to-use controller for web browsers.") module, instead of always
  generating a new browser command.

  This makes it possible to set `BROWSER` to the value of one of the
  supported browsers on macOS.

### zipfile

- Added [`ZipInfo._for_archive`](../library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo._for_archive "zipfile.ZipInfo._for_archive"), a method
  to resolve suitable defaults for a [`ZipInfo`](../library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo "zipfile.ZipInfo") object
  as used by [`ZipFile.writestr`](../library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.writestr "zipfile.ZipFile.writestr").
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-123424](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123424).)
- [`ZipFile.writestr()`](../library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.writestr "zipfile.ZipFile.writestr") now respects the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
  environment variable in order to better support reproducible builds.
  (Contributed by Jiahao Li in [gh-91279](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91279).)

## Optimizations

- The import time for several standard library modules has been improved,
  including [`annotationlib`](../library/annotationlib.html#module-annotationlib "annotationlib: Functionality for introspecting annotations"), [`ast`](../library/ast.html#module-ast "ast: Abstract Syntax Tree classes and manipulation."), [`asyncio`](../library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O."), [`base64`](../library/base64.html#module-base64 "base64: RFC 4648: Base16, Base32, Base64 Data Encodings; Base85 and Ascii85"),
  [`cmd`](../library/cmd.html#module-cmd "cmd: Build line-oriented command interpreters."), [`csv`](../library/csv.html#module-csv "csv: Write and read tabular data to and from delimited files."), [`gettext`](../library/gettext.html#module-gettext "gettext: Multilingual internationalization services."), [`importlib.util`](../library/importlib.html#module-importlib.util "importlib.util: Utility code for importers"), [`locale`](../library/locale.html#module-locale "locale: Internationalization services."),
  [`mimetypes`](../library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes "mimetypes: Mapping of filename extensions to MIME types."), [`optparse`](../library/optparse.html#module-optparse "optparse: Command-line option parsing library."), [`pickle`](../library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back."), [`pprint`](../library/pprint.html#module-pprint "pprint: Data pretty printer."),
  [`pstats`](../library/profile.html#module-pstats "pstats: Statistics object for use with the profiler."), [`shlex`](../library/shlex.html#module-shlex "shlex: Simple lexical analysis for Unix shell-like languages."), [`socket`](../library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface."), [`string`](../library/string.html#module-string "string: Common string operations."), [`subprocess`](../library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess "subprocess: Subprocess management."),

  Hugo van Kemenade, Jelle Zijlstra, and others in [gh-118761](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118761).)
- The interpreter now avoids some reference count modifications internally
  when it’s safe to do so.
  This can lead to different values being returned from [`sys.getrefcount()`](../library/sys.html#sys.getrefcount "sys.getrefcount")
  and [`Py_REFCNT()`](../c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_REFCNT "Py_REFCNT") compared to previous versions of Python.
  See [below](#whatsnew314-refcount) for details.

### asyncio

- Standard benchmark results have improved by 10-20% following the
  implementation of a new per-thread doubly linked list
  for [`native tasks`](../library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task"),
  also reducing memory usage.
  This enables external introspection tools such as
  [python -m asyncio pstree](#whatsnew314-asyncio-introspection)
  to introspect the call graph of asyncio tasks running in all threads.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in [gh-107803](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/107803).)
- The module now has first class support for
  [free-threading builds](../glossary.html#term-free-threading).
  This enables parallel execution of multiple event loops across
  different threads, scaling linearly with the number of threads.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in [gh-128002](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128002).)

### base64

- [`b16decode()`](../library/base64.html#base64.b16decode "base64.b16decode") is now up to six times faster.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran, Chris Markiewicz, and Adam Turner
  in [gh-118761](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118761).)

### bdb

- The basic debugger now has a [`sys.monitoring`](../library/sys.monitoring.html#module-sys.monitoring "sys.monitoring: Access and control event monitoring")-based backend,
  which can be selected via the passing `'monitoring'`
  to the [`Bdb`](../library/bdb.html#bdb.Bdb "bdb.Bdb") class’s new *backend* parameter.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-124533](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124533).)

### difflib

- The [`IS_LINE_JUNK()`](../library/difflib.html#difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK "difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK") function is now up to twice as fast.
  (Contributed by Adam Turner and Semyon Moroz in [gh-130167](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130167).)

### gc

- **From Python 3.14.5 onwards:**

  Python 3.14.0-3.14.4 shipped with a new incremental garbage collector.
  However, due to a number of [reports](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/142516)
  of significant memory pressure in production environments,
  it has been reverted back to the generational GC from 3.13.
  This is the GC now used in Python 3.14.5 and later.
- **Previously in Python 3.14.0-3.14.4:**

  The new [incremental garbage collector](#whatsnew314-incremental-gc)
  means that maximum pause times are reduced
  by an order of magnitude or more for larger heaps.

  Because of this optimization, the meaning of the results of
  [`get_threshold()`](../library/gc.html#gc.get_threshold "gc.get_threshold") and [`set_threshold()`](../library/gc.html#gc.set_threshold "gc.set_threshold") have changed,
  along with [`get_count()`](../library/gc.html#gc.get_count "gc.get_count") and [`get_stats()`](../library/gc.html#gc.get_stats "gc.get_stats").

  - For backwards compatibility, [`get_threshold()`](../library/gc.html#gc.get_threshold "gc.get_threshold") continues to return
    a three-item tuple.
    The first value is the threshold for young collections, as before;
    the second value determines the rate at which the old collection is scanned
    (the default is 10, and higher values mean that the old collection
    is scanned more slowly).
    The third value is now meaningless and is always zero.
  - [`set_threshold()`](../library/gc.html#gc.set_threshold "gc.set_threshold") now ignores any items after the second.
  - [`get_count()`](../library/gc.html#gc.get_count "gc.get_count") and [`get_stats()`](../library/gc.html#gc.get_stats "gc.get_stats") continue to return
    the same format of results.
    The only difference is that instead of the results referring to
    the young, aging and old generations,
    the results refer to the young generation
    and the aging and collecting spaces of the old generation.

  In summary, code that attempted to manipulate the behavior of the cycle GC
  may not work exactly as intended, but it is very unlikely to be harmful.
  All other code will work just fine.

### io

- Opening and reading files now executes fewer system calls.
  Reading a small operating system cached file in full is up to 15% faster.
  (Contributed by Cody Maloney and Victor Stinner
  in [gh-120754](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120754) and [gh-90102](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90102).)

### pathlib

- [`Path.read_bytes`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_bytes "pathlib.Path.read_bytes") now uses unbuffered mode
  to open files, which is between 9% and 17% faster to read in full.
  (Contributed by Cody Maloney in [gh-120754](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120754).)

### pdb

- [`pdb`](../library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") now supports two backends, based on either
  [`sys.settrace()`](../library/sys.html#sys.settrace "sys.settrace") or [`sys.monitoring`](../library/sys.monitoring.html#module-sys.monitoring "sys.monitoring: Access and control event monitoring").
  Using the [pdb CLI](../library/pdb.html#pdb-cli) or [`breakpoint()`](../library/functions.html#breakpoint "breakpoint")
  will always use the `sys.monitoring` backend.
  Explicitly instantiating [`pdb.Pdb`](../library/pdb.html#pdb.Pdb "pdb.Pdb") and its derived classes
  will use the `sys.settrace()` backend by default, which is configurable.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-124533](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124533).)

### textwrap

- Optimize the [`dedent()`](../library/textwrap.html#textwrap.dedent "textwrap.dedent") function, improving performance by
  an average of 2.4x, with larger improvements for bigger inputs,
  and fix a bug with incomplete normalization of blank lines with whitespace
  characters other than space and tab.

### uuid

- [`uuid3()`](../library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid3 "uuid.uuid3") and [`uuid5()`](../library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid5 "uuid.uuid5") are now both roughly 40% faster
  for 16-byte names and 20% faster for 1024-byte names.
  Performance for longer names remains unchanged.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-128150](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128150).)
- [`uuid4()`](../library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid4 "uuid.uuid4") is now c. 30% faster.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-128150](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128150).)

### zlib

- On Windows, [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng)
  is now used as the implementation of the [`zlib`](../library/zlib.html#module-zlib "zlib: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines compatible with gzip.") module
  in the default binaries.
  There are no known incompatibilities between `zlib-ng`
  and the previously-used `zlib` implementation.
  This should result in better performance at all compression levels.

  It is worth noting that `zlib.Z_BEST_SPEED` (`1`) may result in
  significantly less compression than the previous implementation,
  whilst also significantly reducing the time taken to compress.

## Removed

### argparse

- Remove the *type*, *choices*, and *metavar* parameters
  of `BooleanOptionalAction`.
  These have been deprecated since Python 3.12.
  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in [gh-118805](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118805).)
- Calling [`add_argument_group()`](../library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group "argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group")
  on an argument group now raises a [`ValueError`](../library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").
  Similarly, `add_argument_group()`
  or [`add_mutually_exclusive_group()`](../library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group "argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group")
  on a mutually exclusive group now both raise `ValueError`s.
  This ‘nesting’ was never supported, often failed to work correctly,
  and was unintentionally exposed through inheritance.
  This functionality has been deprecated since Python 3.11.
  (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in [gh-127186](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127186).)

### ast

- Remove the following classes, which have been deprecated aliases of
  [`Constant`](../library/ast.html#ast.Constant "ast.Constant") since Python 3.8 and have emitted
  deprecation warnings since Python 3.12:

  - `Bytes`
  - `Ellipsis`
  - `NameConstant`
  - `Num`
  - `Str`

  As a consequence of these removals, user-defined `visit_Num`, `visit_Str`,
  `visit_Bytes`, `visit_NameConstant` and `visit_Ellipsis` methods
  on custom [`NodeVisitor`](../library/ast.html#ast.NodeVisitor "ast.NodeVisitor") subclasses will no longer be called
  when the `NodeVisitor` subclass is visiting an AST.
  Define a `visit_Constant` method instead.

  (Contributed by Alex Waygood in [gh-119562](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119562).)
- Remove the following deprecated properties on [`ast.Constant`](../library/ast.html#ast.Constant "ast.Constant"),
  which were present for compatibility with the now-removed AST classes:

  - `Constant.n`
  - `Constant.s`

  Use `Constant.value` instead.
  (Contributed by Alex Waygood in [gh-119562](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119562).)

### asyncio

- Remove the following classes, methods, and functions,
  which have been deprecated since Python 3.12:

  - `AbstractChildWatcher`
  - `FastChildWatcher`
  - `MultiLoopChildWatcher`
  - `PidfdChildWatcher`
  - `SafeChildWatcher`
  - `ThreadedChildWatcher`
  - `AbstractEventLoopPolicy.get_child_watcher()`
  - `AbstractEventLoopPolicy.set_child_watcher()`
  - `get_child_watcher()`
  - `set_child_watcher()`

  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in [gh-120804](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120804).)
- [`asyncio.get_event_loop()`](../library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.get_event_loop "asyncio.get_event_loop") now raises a [`RuntimeError`](../library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError")
  if there is no current event loop,
  and no longer implicitly creates an event loop.

  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in [gh-126353](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126353).)

  There’s a few patterns that use [`asyncio.get_event_loop()`](../library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.get_event_loop "asyncio.get_event_loop"), most
  of them can be replaced with [`asyncio.run()`](../library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run "asyncio.run").

  If you’re running an async function, simply use [`asyncio.run()`](../library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run "asyncio.run").

  Before:

  ```
  async def main():
      ...

  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
  try:
      loop.run_until_complete(main())
  finally:
      loop.close()
  ```

  After:

  ```
  async def main():
      ...

  asyncio.run(main())
  ```

  If you need to start something, for example, a server listening on a socket
  and then run forever, use [`asyncio.run()`](../library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run "asyncio.run") and an
  [`asyncio.Event`](../library/asyncio-sync.html#asyncio.Event "asyncio.Event").

  Before:

  ```
  def start_server(loop): ...

  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
  try:
      start_server(loop)
      loop.run_forever()
  finally:
      loop.close()
  ```

  After:

  ```
  def start_server(loop): ...

  async def main():
      start_server(asyncio.get_running_loop())
      await asyncio.Event().wait()

  asyncio.run(main())
  ```

  If you need to run something in an event loop, then run some blocking
  code around it, use [`asyncio.Runner`](../library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner "asyncio.Runner").

  Before:

  ```
  async def operation_one(): ...
  def blocking_code(): ...
  async def operation_two(): ...

  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
  try:
      loop.run_until_complete(operation_one())
      blocking_code()
      loop.run_until_complete(operation_two())
  finally:
      loop.close()
  ```

  After:

  ```
  async def operation_one(): ...
  def blocking_code(): ...
  async def operation_two(): ...

  with asyncio.Runner() as runner:
      runner.run(operation_one())
      blocking_code()
      runner.run(operation_two())
  ```

### email

  which was deprecated in and has been ignored since Python 3.12.
  (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-118798](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118798).)

### importlib.abc

  - `Traversable`
    (use [`Traversable`](../library/importlib.resources.abc.html#importlib.resources.abc.Traversable "importlib.resources.abc.Traversable"))
  - `TraversableResources`

  (Contributed by Jason R. Coombs and Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-93963](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93963).)

### itertools

- Remove support for copy, deepcopy, and pickle operations
  from [`itertools`](../library/itertools.html#module-itertools "itertools: Functions creating iterators for efficient looping.") iterators.
  These have emitted a [`DeprecationWarning`](../library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") since Python 3.12.
  (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger in [gh-101588](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101588).)

### pathlib

- Remove support for passing additional keyword arguments
  to [`Path`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path "pathlib.Path").
  In previous versions, any such arguments are ignored.
  (Contributed by Barney Gale in [gh-74033](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74033).)
- Remove support for passing additional positional arguments to
  [`PurePath.relative_to()`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.relative_to "pathlib.PurePath.relative_to") and [`is_relative_to()`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.is_relative_to "pathlib.PurePath.is_relative_to").
  In previous versions, any such arguments are joined onto *other*.

  which have been deprecated since Python 3.12.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-97850](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97850).)

### pty

  the [`sqlite3`](../library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") module;
  use [`sqlite_version`](../library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.sqlite_version "sqlite3.sqlite_version") and [`sqlite_version_info`](../library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.sqlite_version_info "sqlite3.sqlite_version_info")
  for the actual version number of the runtime SQLite library.
  (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-118924](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118924).)

  which have been deprecated since Python 3.3.

  `myopener.open()` can be replaced with [`urlopen()`](../library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.urlopen "urllib.request.urlopen").
  `myopener.retrieve()` can be replaced with
  [`urlretrieve()`](../library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.urlretrieve "urllib.request.urlretrieve").
  Customisations to the opener classes can be replaced by passing
  customized handlers to [`build_opener()`](../library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.build_opener "urllib.request.build_opener").

### Pending removal in Python 3.17

- [`collections.abc`](../library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers"):

  - [`collections.abc.ByteString`](../library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.ByteString "collections.abc.ByteString") is scheduled for removal in Python 3.17.

    Use `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer)` to test if `obj`
    implements the [buffer protocol](../c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) at runtime. For use
    in type annotations, either use [`Buffer`](../library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Buffer "collections.abc.Buffer") or a union
    that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g.,
    `bytes | bytearray | memoryview`).

    `ByteString` was originally intended to be an abstract class that
    would serve as a supertype of both [`bytes`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`bytearray`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray").
    However, since the ABC never had any methods, knowing that an object was an
    instance of `ByteString` never actually told you anything useful
    about the object. Other common buffer types such as [`memoryview`](../library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview")
    were also never understood as subtypes of `ByteString` (either at
    runtime or by static type checkers).

- [`typing`](../library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints (see :pep:`484`)."):

  - Before Python 3.14, old-style unions were implemented using the private class
    `typing._UnionGenericAlias`. This class is no longer needed for the implementation,
    but it has been retained for backward compatibility, with removal scheduled for Python
    3.17. Users should use documented introspection helpers like [`typing.get_origin()`](../library/typing.html#typing.get_origin "typing.get_origin")
    and [`typing.get_args()`](../library/typing.html#typing.get_args "typing.get_args") instead of relying on private implementation details.
  - [`typing.ByteString`](../library/typing.html#typing.ByteString "typing.ByteString"), deprecated since Python 3.9, is scheduled for removal in
    Python 3.17.

    Use `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer)` to test if `obj`
    implements the [buffer protocol](../c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) at runtime. For use
    in type annotations, either use [`Buffer`](../library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Buffer "collections.abc.Buffer") or a union
    that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g.,
    `bytes | bytearray | memoryview`).

    `ByteString` was originally intended to be an abstract class that
    would serve as a supertype of both [`bytes`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`bytearray`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray").
    However, since the ABC never had any methods, knowing that an object was an
    instance of `ByteString` never actually told you anything useful
    about the object. Other common buffer types such as [`memoryview`](../library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview")
    were also never understood as subtypes of `ByteString` (either at
    runtime or by static type checkers).

    See [**PEP 688**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0688/#current-options) for more details.

### Pending removal in Python 3.18

- [`decimal`](../library/decimal.html#module-decimal "decimal: Implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification."):

  - The non-standard and undocumented [`Decimal`](../library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") format
    specifier `'N'`, which is only supported in the `decimal` module’s
    C implementation, has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
    (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-89902](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89902).)

### Pending removal in Python 3.19

- [`ctypes`](../library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python."):

  - Implicitly switching to the MSVC-compatible struct layout by setting
    [`_pack_`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure._pack_ "ctypes.Structure._pack_") but not [`_layout_`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure._layout_ "ctypes.Structure._layout_")
    on non-Windows platforms.

### Pending removal in future versions

The following APIs will be removed in the future,
although there is currently no date scheduled for their removal.

- [`argparse`](../library/argparse.html#module-argparse "argparse: Command-line option and argument parsing library."):

  - Nesting argument groups and nesting mutually exclusive
    groups are deprecated.
  - Passing the undocumented keyword argument *prefix\_chars* to
    [`add_argument_group()`](../library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group "argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group") is now
    deprecated.
  - The [`argparse.FileType`](../library/argparse.html#argparse.FileType "argparse.FileType") type converter is deprecated.
- [`builtins`](../library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."):

  - Generators: `throw(type, exc, tb)` and `athrow(type, exc, tb)`
    signature is deprecated: use `throw(exc)` and `athrow(exc)` instead,
    the single argument signature.
  - Currently Python accepts numeric literals immediately followed by keywords,
    for example `0in x`, `1or x`, `0if 1else 2`. It allows confusing and
    ambiguous expressions like `[0x1for x in y]` (which can be interpreted as
    `[0x1 for x in y]` or `[0x1f or x in y]`). A syntax warning is raised
    if the numeric literal is immediately followed by one of keywords
    [`and`](../reference/expressions.html#and), [`else`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#else), [`for`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#for), [`if`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#if),
    [`in`](../reference/expressions.html#in), [`is`](../reference/expressions.html#is) and [`or`](../reference/expressions.html#or). In a future release it
    will be changed to a syntax error. ([gh-87999](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87999))
  - Support for `__index__()` and `__int__()` method returning non-int type:
    these methods will be required to return an instance of a strict subclass of
    [`int`](../library/functions.html#int "int").

    [`float`](../library/functions.html#float "float"): these methods will be required to return an instance of
    `float`.
  - Support for `__complex__()` method returning a strict subclass of
    [`complex`](../library/functions.html#complex "complex"): these methods will be required to return an instance of
    `complex`.
  - Passing a complex number as the *real* or *imag* argument in the
    [`complex()`](../library/functions.html#complex "complex") constructor is now deprecated; it should only be passed
    as a single positional argument.
    (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-109218](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109218).)

    use `datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.UTC)`.
  - [`utcfromtimestamp()`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp "datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp"):
    use `datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, tz=datetime.UTC)`.
- [`gettext`](../library/gettext.html#module-gettext "gettext: Multilingual internationalization services."): Plural value must be an integer.

  (Contributed by Mark Shannon in [gh-122548](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122548).)

## C API changes

### Python configuration C API

Add a [PyInitConfig C API](../c-api/init_config.html#pyinitconfig-api) to configure the Python
initialization without relying on C structures and the ability to make
ABI-compatible changes in the future.

Complete the [**PEP 587**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0587/) [PyConfig C API](../c-api/init_config.html#pyconfig-api) by adding
[`PyInitConfig_AddModule()`](../c-api/init_config.html#c.PyInitConfig_AddModule "PyInitConfig_AddModule") which can be used to add a built-in extension
module; a feature previously referred to as the “inittab”.

Add [`PyConfig_Get()`](../c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig_Get "PyConfig_Get") and [`PyConfig_Set()`](../c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig_Set "PyConfig_Set") functions to get and set
the current runtime configuration.

[**PEP 587**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0587/) ‘Python Initialization Configuration’ unified all the ways
to configure Python’s initialization. This PEP also unifies the configuration
of Python’s preinitialization and initialization in a single API.
Moreover, this PEP only provides a single choice to embed Python,
instead of having two ‘Python’ and ‘Isolated’ choices (PEP 587),
to further simplify the API.

The lower level PEP 587 PyConfig API remains available for use cases
with an intentionally higher level of coupling to CPython implementation details
(such as emulating the full functionality of CPython’s CLI, including its
configuration mechanisms).

  two new macros for bit-packing Python version numbers.
  This is useful for comparisons with [`Py_Version`](../c-api/apiabiversion.html#c.Py_Version "Py_Version")
  or [`PY_VERSION_HEX`](../c-api/apiabiversion.html#c.PY_VERSION_HEX "PY_VERSION_HEX").

- Add [`Py_fopen()`](../c-api/sys.html#c.Py_fopen "Py_fopen") function to open a file.
  This works similarly to the standard C `fopen()` function,
  instead accepting a Python object for the *path* parameter
  and setting an exception on error.
  The corresponding new [`Py_fclose()`](../c-api/sys.html#c.Py_fclose "Py_fclose") function should be used
  to close a file.

  and [`PySequence_Fast_ITEMS`](../c-api/sequence.html#c.PySequence_Fast_ITEMS "PySequence_Fast_ITEMS")
  macros from the limited C API, since they have always been broken
  in the limited C API.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-91417](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91417).)

### Removed C APIs

- Creating [`immutable types`](../c-api/typeobj.html#c.Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE "Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE") with
  mutable bases was deprecated in Python 3.12,
  and now raises a [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

  (Contributed by Sam Gross in [gh-124296](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124296).)
- Remove the private `_Py_InitializeMain()` function.
  It was a [provisional API](../glossary.html#term-provisional-API) added to Python 3.8 by [**PEP 587**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0587/).
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-129033](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129033).)
- Remove the undocumented APIs `Py_C_RECURSION_LIMIT`
  and `PyThreadState.c_recursion_remaining`.
  These were added in 3.13 and have been removed without deprecation.
  Use [`Py_EnterRecursiveCall()`](../c-api/exceptions.html#c.Py_EnterRecursiveCall "Py_EnterRecursiveCall") to guard against runaway
  recursion in C code.
  (Removed by Petr Viktorin in [gh-133079](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133079), see also [gh-130396](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130396).)

  instead, available from `math.h` since C99.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-119613](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119613).)
- Non-tuple sequences are now deprecated as argument for the `(items)`
  format unit in [`PyArg_ParseTuple()`](../c-api/arg.html#c.PyArg_ParseTuple "PyArg_ParseTuple") and other [argument
  parsing](../c-api/arg.html#arg-parsing) functions if *items* contains format units
  which store a [borrowed buffer](../c-api/arg.html#c-arg-borrowed-buffer) or a
  [borrowed reference](../glossary.html#term-borrowed-reference).
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-50333](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/50333).)
- The `_PyMonitoring_FireBranchEvent` function is now deprecated
  and should be replaced with calls to
  [`PyMonitoring_FireBranchLeftEvent()`](../c-api/monitoring.html#c.PyMonitoring_FireBranchLeftEvent "PyMonitoring_FireBranchLeftEvent") and
  [`PyMonitoring_FireBranchRightEvent()`](../c-api/monitoring.html#c.PyMonitoring_FireBranchRightEvent "PyMonitoring_FireBranchRightEvent").
- The previously undocumented function [`PySequence_In()`](../c-api/sequence.html#c.PySequence_In "PySequence_In") is
  now [soft deprecated](../glossary.html#term-soft-deprecated).

  - [`Py_LegacyWindowsStdioFlag`](../c-api/interp-lifecycle.html#c.Py_LegacyWindowsStdioFlag "Py_LegacyWindowsStdioFlag"):
    Use [`PyConfig.legacy_windows_stdio`](../c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig.legacy_windows_stdio "PyConfig.legacy_windows_stdio") or
    [`PyConfig_Get("legacy_windows_stdio")`](../c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig_Get "PyConfig_Get") instead.

  The [`Py_InitializeFromConfig()`](../c-api/interp-lifecycle.html#c.Py_InitializeFromConfig "Py_InitializeFromConfig") API should be used with
  [`PyConfig`](../c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig "PyConfig") to set these options. Or [`PyConfig_Get()`](../c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig_Get "PyConfig_Get") can be
  used to get these options at runtime.

## Build changes

- [**PEP 776**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0776/): Emscripten is now an officially supported platform at
  [**tier 3**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3). As a part of this effort, more than 25 bugs in
  [Emscripten libc](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/emscripten-runtime-environment.html) were fixed. Emscripten now includes support
  for [`ctypes`](../library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python."), [`termios`](../library/termios.html#module-termios "termios: POSIX style tty control."), and [`fcntl`](../library/fcntl.html#module-fcntl "fcntl: The fcntl() and ioctl() system calls."), as well as
  experimental support for the new [default interactive shell](../tutorial/interpreter.html#tut-interactive).

- Official Android binary releases are now provided on [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/android/).
- GNU Autoconf 2.72 is now required to generate `configure`.
  (Contributed by Erlend Aasland in [gh-115765](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115765).)
- `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` is now a [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) tier 3 platform.
  (Contributed by R. Hood Chatham in [gh-127146](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127146), [gh-127683](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127683), and [gh-136931](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/136931).)
- `#pragma`-based linking with `python3*.lib` can now be switched off
  with [Py\_NO\_LINK\_LIB](../extending/windows.html#c.Py_NO_LINK_LIB "Py_NO_LINK_LIB").
  (Contributed by Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin in [gh-82909](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82909).)
- CPython now enables a set of recommended compiler options by default
  for improved security.
  Use the [`--disable-safety`](../using/configure.html#cmdoption-disable-safety) `configure` option to disable them,
  or the [`--enable-slower-safety`](../using/configure.html#cmdoption-enable-slower-safety) option for a larger set
  of compiler options, albeit with a performance cost.
- The `WITH_FREELISTS` macro and `--without-freelists` `configure`
  option have been removed.
- The new `configure` option [`--with-tail-call-interp`](../using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-tail-call-interp)
  may be used to enable the experimental tail call interpreter.
  See [A new type of interpreter](#whatsnew314-tail-call-interpreter) for further details.
- To disable the new remote debugging support, use the
  [`--without-remote-debug`](../using/configure.html#cmdoption-without-remote-debug) `configure` option.
  This may be useful for security reasons.
- iOS and macOS apps can now be configured to redirect `stdout` and
  `stderr` content to the system log.
  (Contributed by Russell Keith-Magee in [gh-127592](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127592).)
- The iOS testbed is now able to stream test output while the test is running.
  The testbed can also be used to run the test suite of projects other than
  CPython itself.

### `build-details.json`

Installations of Python now contain a new file, `build-details.json`.
This is a static JSON document containing build details for CPython,
to allow for introspection without needing to run code.
This is helpful for use-cases such as Python launchers, cross-compilation,
and so on.

`build-details.json` must be installed in the platform-independent
standard library directory. This corresponds to the [‘stdlib’](../library/sysconfig.html#installation-paths) [`sysconfig`](../library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information") installation path,
which can be found by running `sysconfig.get_path('stdlib')`.

### Discontinuation of PGP signatures

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) signatures will not be provided
for releases of Python 3.14 or future versions.
To verify CPython artifacts, users must use [Sigstore verification materials](https://www.python.org/downloads/metadata/sigstore/).
Releases have been signed using [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) since Python 3.11.

This change in release process was specified in [**PEP 761**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0761/).

### Free-threaded Python is officially supported

The free-threaded build of Python is now supported and no longer experimental.
This is the start of [phase II](https://discuss.python.org/t/37075) where
free-threaded Python is officially supported but still optional.

The free-threading team are confident that the project is on the right path,
and appreciate the continued dedication from everyone working to make
free-threading ready for broader adoption across the Python community.

With these recommendations and the acceptance of this PEP, the Python developer
community should broadly advertise that free-threading is a supported
Python build option now and into the future, and that it will not be removed
without a proper deprecation schedule.

Any decision to transition to [phase III](https://discuss.python.org/t/37075),
with free-threading as the default or sole build of Python is still undecided,
and dependent on many factors both within CPython itself and the community.
This decision is for the future.

[**PEP 779**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0779/)

[PEP 779’s acceptance](https://discuss.python.org/t/84319/123)

### Binary releases for the experimental just-in-time compiler

The official macOS and Windows release binaries now include an *experimental*
just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Although it is **not** recommended for production
use, it can be tested by setting [`PYTHON_JIT=1`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_JIT) as an
environment variable. Downstream source builds and redistributors can use the
[`--enable-experimental-jit=yes-off`](../using/configure.html#cmdoption-enable-experimental-jit) configuration option for similar
behavior.

The JIT is at an early stage and still in active development. As such, the
typical performance impact of enabling it can range from 10% slower to 20%
faster, depending on workload. To aid in testing and evaluation, a set of
introspection functions has been provided in the [`sys._jit`](../library/sys.html#sys._jit "sys._jit") namespace.
[`sys._jit.is_available()`](../library/sys.html#sys._jit.is_available "sys._jit.is_available") can be used to determine if the current executable
supports JIT compilation, while [`sys._jit.is_enabled()`](../library/sys.html#sys._jit.is_enabled "sys._jit.is_enabled") can be used to tell
if JIT compilation has been enabled for the current process.

Currently, the most significant missing functionality is that native debuggers
and profilers like `gdb` and `perf` are unable to unwind through JIT frames
(Python debuggers and profilers, like [`pdb`](../library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") or [`profile`](../library/profile.html#module-profile "profile: Python source profiler."), continue to
work without modification). Free-threaded builds do not support JIT compilation.

Please report any bugs or major performance regressions that you encounter!

## Porting to Python 3.14

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes
that may require changes to your code.

### Changes in the Python API

- On Unix platforms other than macOS, *forkserver* is now the default
  [start method](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-methods) for [`multiprocessing`](../library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.")
  and [`ProcessPoolExecutor`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor"), instead of *fork*.

  See [(1)](#whatsnew314-concurrent-futures-start-method) and
  [(2)](#whatsnew314-multiprocessing-start-method) for details.

  If you encounter [`NameError`](../library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError")s or pickling errors coming out of
  [`multiprocessing`](../library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.") or [`concurrent.futures`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures "concurrent.futures: Execute computations concurrently using threads or processes."), see the
  [forkserver restrictions](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming-forkserver).

  This change does not affect Windows or macOS, where [‘spawn’](../library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-spawn) remains the default start method.
- [`functools.partial`](../library/functools.html#functools.partial "functools.partial") is now a method descriptor.
  Wrap it in [`staticmethod()`](../library/functions.html#staticmethod "staticmethod") if you want to preserve the old behavior.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka and Dominykas Grigonis in [gh-121027](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121027).)
- The [garbage collector is now incremental](#whatsnew314-incremental-gc),
  which means that the behavior of [`gc.collect()`](../library/gc.html#gc.collect "gc.collect") changes slightly:

  - `gc.collect(1)`: Performs an increment of garbage collection,
    rather than collecting generation 1.
  - Other calls to `gc.collect()` are unchanged.
- The [`locale.nl_langinfo()`](../library/locale.html#locale.nl_langinfo "locale.nl_langinfo") function now temporarily sets the `LC_CTYPE`
  locale in some cases.
  This temporary change affects other threads.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-69998](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/69998).)
- [`pickle.dump()`](../library/pickle.html#pickle.dump "pickle.dump") and [`pickle.dumps()`](../library/pickle.html#pickle.dumps "pickle.dumps") now raise
  [`PicklingError`](../library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError "pickle.PicklingError") for some failures that previously raised
  [`AttributeError`](../library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError"), [`ImportError`](../library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError"), [`ValueError`](../library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"),
  [`UnicodeEncodeError`](../library/exceptions.html#UnicodeEncodeError "UnicodeEncodeError") or `PicklingError`,
  depending on the implementation
  (for example, pickling a local object, or an object whose module cannot be imported).
  The original exception is chained to the `PicklingError`.
  Code that caught these exceptions should also catch `PicklingError`.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-122311](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122311).)
- [`types.UnionType`](../library/types.html#types.UnionType "types.UnionType") is now an alias for [`typing.Union`](../library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union"),
  causing changes in some behaviors.
  See [above](#whatsnew314-typing-union) for more details.
  (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-105499](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105499).)
- The runtime behavior of annotations has changed in various ways; see
  [above](#whatsnew314-deferred-annotations) for details. While most code that interacts
  with annotations should continue to work, some undocumented details may behave
  differently.
- As part of making the [`mimetypes`](../library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes "mimetypes: Mapping of filename extensions to MIME types.") CLI public,
  it now exits with `1` on failure instead of `0`
  and `2` on incorrect command-line parameters instead of `1`.
  Error messages are now printed to stderr.
- The `\B` pattern in regular expression now matches the empty string
  when given as the entire pattern, which may cause behavioural changes.
- On FreeBSD, [`sys.platform`](../library/sys.html#sys.platform "sys.platform") no longer contains the major version number.

### Changes in annotations ([**PEP 649**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/) and [**PEP 749**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0749/))

This section contains guidance on changes that may be needed to annotations
or Python code that interacts with or introspects annotations,
due to the changes related to [deferred evaluation of annotations](#whatsnew314-deferred-annotations).

In the majority of cases, working code from older versions of Python
will not require any changes.

#### Implications for annotated code

If you define annotations in your code (for example, for use with a static type
checker), then this change probably does not affect you: you can keep
writing annotations the same way you did with previous versions of Python.

You will likely be able to remove quoted strings in annotations, which are frequently
used for forward references. Similarly, if you use `from __future__ import annotations`
to avoid having to write strings in annotations, you may well be able to
remove that import once you support only Python 3.14 and newer.
However, if you rely on third-party libraries that read annotations,
those libraries may need changes to support unquoted annotations before they
work as expected.

#### Implications for readers of `__annotations__`

If your code reads the [`__annotations__`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__annotations__ "object.__annotations__") attribute on objects,
you may want to make changes in order to support code that relies on
deferred evaluation of annotations.
For example, you may want to use [`annotationlib.get_annotations()`](../library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.get_annotations "annotationlib.get_annotations") with
the [`FORWARDREF`](../library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF "annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF") format,
as the [`dataclasses`](../library/dataclasses.html#module-dataclasses "dataclasses: Generate special methods on user-defined classes.") module now does.

The external [typing\_extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing_extensions/) package provides partial backports
of some of the functionality of the [`annotationlib`](../library/annotationlib.html#module-annotationlib "annotationlib: Functionality for introspecting annotations") module,
such as the [`Format`](../library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format "annotationlib.Format") enum and
the [`get_annotations()`](../library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.get_annotations "annotationlib.get_annotations") function.
These can be used to write cross-version code that takes advantage of
the new behavior in Python 3.14.

#### Related changes

The changes in Python 3.14 are designed to rework how `__annotations__`
works at runtime while minimizing breakage to code that contains
annotations in source code and to code that reads `__annotations__`.
However, if you rely on undocumented details of the annotation behavior
or on private functions in the standard library, there are many ways in which
your code may not work in Python 3.14.
To safeguard your code against future changes, only use the documented
functionality of the [`annotationlib`](../library/annotationlib.html#module-annotationlib "annotationlib: Functionality for introspecting annotations") module.

In particular, do not read annotations directly from the namespace dictionary
attribute of type objects.
Use [`annotationlib.get_annotate_from_class_namespace()`](../library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.get_annotate_from_class_namespace "annotationlib.get_annotate_from_class_namespace") during class
construction and [`annotationlib.get_annotations()`](../library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.get_annotations "annotationlib.get_annotations") afterwards.

In previous releases, it was sometimes possible to access class annotations
from an instance of an annotated class. This behavior was undocumented
and accidental, and will no longer work in Python 3.14.

#### `from __future__ import annotations`

In Python 3.7, [**PEP 563**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/) introduced the `from __future__ import annotations`
[future statement](../reference/simple_stmts.html#future), which turns all annotations into strings.

However, this statement is now deprecated and it is expected to be removed
in a future version of Python.
This removal will not happen until after Python 3.13 reaches its end of life
in 2029, being the last version of Python without support for deferred
evaluation of annotations.

In Python 3.14, the behavior of code using `from __future__ import annotations`
is unchanged.

### Changes in the C API

- [`Py_Finalize()`](../c-api/interp-lifecycle.html#c.Py_Finalize "Py_Finalize") now deletes all interned strings. This
  is backwards incompatible to any C extension that holds onto an interned
  string after a call to `Py_Finalize()` and is then reused after a
  call to [`Py_Initialize()`](../c-api/interp-lifecycle.html#c.Py_Initialize "Py_Initialize"). Any issues arising from this behavior will
  normally result in crashes during the execution of the subsequent call to
  `Py_Initialize()` from accessing uninitialized memory. To fix, use
  an address sanitizer to identify any use-after-free coming from
  an interned string and deallocate it during module shutdown.
  (Contributed by Eddie Elizondo in [gh-113601](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113601).)
- The [Unicode Exception Objects](../c-api/exceptions.html#unicodeexceptions) C API
  now raises a [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") if its exception argument is not
  a [`UnicodeError`](../library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError") object.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-127691](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127691).)

- The interpreter internally avoids some reference count modifications when
  loading objects onto the operands stack by [borrowing](../glossary.html#term-borrowed-reference)
  references when possible. This can lead to smaller reference count values
  compared to previous Python versions. C API extensions that checked
  [`Py_REFCNT()`](../c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_REFCNT "Py_REFCNT") of `1` to determine if an function argument is not
  referenced by any other code should instead use
  [`PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary()`](../c-api/object.html#c.PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary "PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary") as a safer replacement.

  The [pythoncapi-compat project](https://github.com/python/pythoncapi-compat/) can be used to get most of these new
  functions on Python 3.13 and older.

## Notable changes in 3.14.1

- Add [`PyUnstable_ThreadState_SetStackProtection()`](../c-api/threads.html#c.PyUnstable_ThreadState_SetStackProtection "PyUnstable_ThreadState_SetStackProtection") and
  [`PyUnstable_ThreadState_ResetStackProtection()`](../c-api/threads.html#c.PyUnstable_ThreadState_ResetStackProtection "PyUnstable_ThreadState_ResetStackProtection") functions to set
  the stack protection base address and stack protection size of a Python
  thread state.

## Notable changes in 3.14.5

### gc

- The incremental garbage collector shipped in Python 3.14.0-3.14.4 has been
  reverted back to the generational garbage collector from 3.13,
  due to a number of [reports](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/142516)
  of significant memory pressure in production environments.
  See [Garbage collection](#whatsnew314-incremental-gc) for details.
