# `asyncio` — Asynchronous I/O

---

asyncio is a library to write **concurrent** code using
the **async/await** syntax.

asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous
frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers,
database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.

asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level
**structured** network code.

[A Conceptual Overview of asyncio](../howto/a-conceptual-overview-of-asyncio.html#a-conceptual-overview-of-asyncio)
:   Explanation of the fundamentals of asyncio.

asyncio provides a set of **high-level** APIs to:

- [run Python coroutines](asyncio-task.html#coroutine) concurrently and
  have full control over their execution;
- perform [network IO and IPC](asyncio-stream.html#asyncio-streams);
- control [subprocesses](asyncio-subprocess.html#asyncio-subprocess);
- distribute tasks via [queues](asyncio-queue.html#asyncio-queues);
- [synchronize](asyncio-sync.html#asyncio-sync) concurrent code;

For **introspection**, asyncio provides APIs and tools for:

- inspecting the [async call graph](asyncio-graph.html#asyncio-graph) of tasks and futures;
- inspecting tasks in another running Python process with
  [command-line tools](asyncio-tools.html#asyncio-introspection-tools);

Additionally, there are **low-level** APIs for
*library and framework developers* to:

- create and manage [event loops](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio-event-loop), which
  provide asynchronous APIs for [networking](asyncio-eventloop.html#loop-create-server),
  running [subprocesses](asyncio-eventloop.html#loop-subprocess-exec),
  handling [OS signals](asyncio-eventloop.html#loop-add-signal-handler), etc;
- implement efficient protocols using
  [transports](asyncio-protocol.html#asyncio-transports-protocols);
- [bridge](asyncio-future.html#asyncio-futures) callback-based libraries and code
  with async/await syntax.

This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly. See
[WebAssembly platforms](intro.html#wasm-availability) for more information.

asyncio REPL

You can experiment with an `asyncio` concurrent context in the [REPL](../glossary.html#term-REPL):

```
$ python -m asyncio
asyncio REPL ...
Use "await" directly instead of "asyncio.run()".
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import asyncio
>>> await asyncio.sleep(10, result='hello')
'hello'
```

This REPL provides limited compatibility with [`PYTHON_BASIC_REPL`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_BASIC_REPL).
It is recommended that the default REPL is used
for full functionality and the latest features.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.html#auditing) `cpython.run_stdin` with no arguments.

Changed in version 3.12.5: (also 3.11.10, 3.10.15, 3.9.20, and 3.8.20)
Emits audit events.

Changed in version 3.13: Uses PyREPL if possible, in which case [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) is
also executed. Emits audit events.
