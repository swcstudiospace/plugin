# flex-grow

Utilities for controlling how flex items grow.

| Class | Styles |
| --- | --- |
| `grow` | `flex-grow: 1;` |
| `grow-<number>` | `flex-grow: <number>;` |
| `grow-[<value>]` | `flex-grow: <value>;` |
| `grow-(<custom-property>)` | `flex-grow: var(<custom-property>);` |

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Allowing items to grow](#allowing-items-to-grow)

Use `grow` to allow a flex item to grow to fill any available space:

01

02

03

```
<div class="flex ...">  <div class="size-14 flex-none ...">01</div>  <div class="size-14 grow ...">02</div>  <div class="size-14 flex-none ...">03</div></div>
```

### [Growing items based on factor](#growing-items-based-on-factor)

Use `grow-<number>` utilities like `grow-3` to make flex items grow proportionally based on their growth factor, allowing them to fill the available space relative to each other:

01

02

03

```
<div class="flex ...">  <div class="size-14 grow-3 ...">01</div>  <div class="size-14 grow-7 ...">02</div>  <div class="size-14 grow-3 ...">03</div></div>
```

### [Preventing items from growing](#preventing-items-from-growing)

Use `grow-0` to prevent a flex item from growing:

01

02

03

```
<div class="flex ...">  <div class="size-14 grow ...">01</div>  <div class="size-14 grow-0 ...">02</div>  <div class="size-14 grow ...">03</div></div>
```

### [Using a custom value](#using-a-custom-value)

Use the `grow-[<value>]` syntax to set the flex grow factor based on a completely custom value:

```
<div class="grow-[25vw] ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

For CSS variables, you can also use the `grow-(<custom-property>)` syntax:

```
<div class="grow-(--my-grow) ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

This is just a shorthand for `grow-[var(<custom-property>)]` that adds the `var()` function for you automatically.

### [Responsive design](#responsive-design)

Prefix a `flex-grow` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```
<div class="grow md:grow-0 ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).
