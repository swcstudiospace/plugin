# Conversational Workflows - Agno

Source: https://docs.agno.com/workflows/conversational-workflows

v2.2.6
Add a `WorkflowAgent` to give a workflow a multi-turn interface. For each message, the agent either answers from recent workflow history or runs the workflow for new work.

## [​](#quick-start) Quick Start

```
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.workflow import Step, WorkflowAgent
from agno.workflow.types import StepInput, StepOutput
from agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow

def draft_response(step_input: StepInput) -> StepOutput:
    return StepOutput(content=f"Processed: {step_input.input}")

workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    num_history_runs=4,
)

workflow = Workflow(
    name="support_workflow",
    description="Process support requests",
    agent=workflow_agent,
    steps=[Step(name="draft_response", executor=draft_response)],
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="workflow.db"),
)
```

`WorkflowAgent` is a restricted `Agent` configured for workflow orchestration. The workflow supplies its `run_workflow` tool.

## [​](#workflow-history-for-conversational-workflows) Workflow History for Conversational Workflows

The `WorkflowAgent` receives recent workflow runs from the current session. This context supports follow-up questions and comparisons across prior results.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `add_workflow_history` | `True` | Add recent workflow runs to the agent context |
| `num_history_runs` | `5` | Maximum number of recent runs to include |

Configure a database on the workflow to persist session history between process restarts. See [Workflow history](/history/workflow/overview).

## [​](#instructions-for-the-workflowagent) Instructions for the WorkflowAgent

The default instructions direct the agent to answer from history when possible and call `run_workflow` once for new work. Pass `instructions` to replace that decision policy. Workflow context is appended automatically unless the instructions already contain `{workflow_context}`.

```
workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    num_history_runs=4,
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions and run workflows when new processing is needed.",
)
```

## [​](#usage-example) Usage Example

```
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.postgres import PostgresDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.workflow import WorkflowAgent
from agno.workflow.types import StepInput
from agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow

db_url = "postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"

story_writer = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    instructions="Write a 100-word story about the requested topic.",
)

story_formatter = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    instructions="Format the story into a prologue, body, and epilogue.",
)

def add_references(step_input: StepInput) -> str:
    previous_output = step_input.previous_step_content or ""
    return previous_output + "\n\nReferences: https://www.agno.com"

workflow_agent = WorkflowAgent(model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"), num_history_runs=4)

workflow = Workflow(
    name="Story Generation Workflow",
    description="A workflow that generates stories, formats them, and adds references",
    agent=workflow_agent,
    steps=[story_writer, story_formatter, add_references],
    db=PostgresDb(db_url),
)

# New topic
workflow.print_response(
    "Tell me a story about a dog named Rocky", stream=True
)

# Follow-up about a previous result
workflow.print_response(
    "What was Rocky's personality?", stream=True
)

# Another new topic
workflow.print_response(
    "Now tell me a story about a cat named Luna", stream=True
)

# Comparison across previous results
workflow.print_response(
    "Compare Rocky and Luna", stream=True
)
```
