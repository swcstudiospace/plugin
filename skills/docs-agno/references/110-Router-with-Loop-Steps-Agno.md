# Router with Loop Steps - Agno

Source: https://docs.agno.com/workflows/usage/router-with-loop-steps

A `Router` can choose a `Loop` as one of its paths. This selector routes a topic to either one web research step or an iterative Hacker News research loop.

## [​](#how-it-works) How it works

- The selector checks the topic against the deep-tech keywords.
- Matching topics run the `Loop`, which stops at the quality threshold or `max_iterations`.
- Other topics run one web research step.
- Both paths feed the publishing step.

## [​](#example) Example

The workflow switches between one web search and iterative tech research.
