# Building Workflows - Agno

Source: https://docs.agno.com/workflows/building-workflows

Workflows orchestrate your agents and teams as a series of steps executed in a flow that you control.

## [​](#building-blocks) Building Blocks

1. **`Workflow`** manages the run and executes its configured steps.
2. **`Step`** wraps exactly one executor: an `Agent`, a `Team`, a custom Python function, or a nested `Workflow`.
3. **`Steps`** groups steps into a named sequential unit.
4. **`Loop`** repeats one or more steps until an end condition succeeds or the iteration cap is reached.
5. **`Parallel`** runs independent steps concurrently and aggregates their outputs.
6. **`Condition`** runs its steps when a boolean evaluator passes and an optional else branch when it fails.
7. **`Router`** picks which step or steps run next from its choices.

When using a custom Python function as an executor for a step, `StepInput` and
`StepOutput` provide standard interfaces for data flow between steps.

## [​](#your-first-workflow) Your First Workflow

You can mix agents, teams, and functions as steps in the same workflow:

mixed\_workflow.py

```
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team import Team
from agno.workflow import StepInput, StepOutput, Workflow

research_team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[
        Agent(
            name="Researcher",
            instructions="Research the requested market and list the main competitors.",
        )
    ],
)

content_agent = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="Turn the supplied research into a concise competitive analysis.",
)

def data_preprocessor(step_input: StepInput) -> StepOutput:
    research = step_input.previous_step_content or "No research was returned."
    return StepOutput(content=f"Research to analyze:\n{research}")

workflow = Workflow(
    name="Mixed Execution Pipeline",
    steps=[
        research_team,
        data_preprocessor,
        content_agent,
    ],
)

workflow.print_response(
    "Analyze the competitive landscape for fintech startups",
    markdown=True,
)
```

## [​](#install) Install

```
uv pip install -U agno openai
```

## [​](#set-openai-key) Set OpenAI Key

Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable. You can get one [from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Mac

Windows

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

```
setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
```
