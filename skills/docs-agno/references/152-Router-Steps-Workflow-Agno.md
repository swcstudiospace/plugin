# Router Steps Workflow - Agno

Source: https://docs.agno.com/workflows/usage/router-steps-workflow

Use `Router` to pick one execution path based on the input. A selector function looks
at the topic and returns the step to run, so each request gets the research method
that fits it.
**When to use**: Mutually exclusive execution paths based on business logic. A
`Condition` gates its steps with a boolean check. A `Router` picks which of its choices
to run.
Install dependencies:

```
uv pip install agno openai ddgs
```
