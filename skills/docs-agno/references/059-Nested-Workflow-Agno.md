# Nested Workflow - Agno

Source: https://docs.agno.com/workflows/workflow-patterns/nested-workflow

Pass a `Workflow` as a step inside another `Workflow`. The inner workflow runs as a single step in the outer workflow, with output chained to the next step.

## [​](#basic-example) Basic Example

nested\_workflow.py

```
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.workflow import Step, StepInput, StepOutput, Workflow

def create_summary(step_input: StepInput) -> StepOutput:
    previous_content = step_input.get_last_step_content()
    summary = (
        f"Summary of research:\n{previous_content[:500]}..."
        if previous_content
        else "No content to summarize"
    )
    return StepOutput(content=summary)

# Inner workflow: research pipeline
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Research Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    instructions="You are a research assistant. Provide concise, factual information.",
)

inner_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Research Workflow",
    steps=[
        Step(name="research", agent=research_agent),
        Step(name="summary", executor=create_summary),
    ],
)

# Outer workflow: uses inner workflow as a step
writer_agent = Agent(
    name="Writer Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    instructions="Take the research provided and write a polished article.",
)

outer_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Research and Write Workflow",
    steps=[
        Step(name="research_phase", workflow=inner_workflow),
        Step(name="writing_phase", agent=writer_agent),
    ],
)

outer_workflow.print_response(
    input="Tell me about the history of artificial intelligence",
    stream=True,
)
```

The outer workflow runs `inner_workflow` as its first step. The inner workflow’s output flows into the `writing_phase` step.

## [​](#how-it-works) How It Works

1. The outer workflow reaches a step with `workflow=inner_workflow`
2. The inner workflow executes with `.run()` or `.arun()` and receives the prepared input
3. The parent passes its session ID, user ID, and current session state into the nested run
4. The inner workflow’s output is converted to a `StepOutput` with `step_type=StepType.WORKFLOW`
5. Execution continues to the next step in the outer workflow

## [​](#two-ways-to-declare) Two Ways to Declare

| Method | Syntax | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit `Step` wrapper | `Step(name="research", workflow=inner_workflow)` | Custom step name, clarity |
| Auto-wrap | `steps=[inner_workflow]` | Concise shorthand (uses the workflow’s `name` as step name) |

Using `inner_workflow` from the basic example:

```
steps=[Step(name="Research Workflow", workflow=inner_workflow)]
steps=[inner_workflow]
```

## [​](#inner-workflows-and-primitives) Inner Workflows and Primitives

An inner workflow can use the same primitives and combinations as a top-level workflow: agents, teams, functions, `Step`, `Steps`, `Condition`, `Loop`, `Router`, `Parallel`, and other nested workflows.
The [basic example](#basic-example) uses agent and executor steps inside the inner workflow. [Deep nesting](#deep-nesting) shows multiple levels with `Parallel` and sub-workflows.

| Primitive | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Condition` | Branch on a boolean evaluator |
| `Loop` | Repeat steps until an end condition or max iterations |
| `Router` | Choose a branch from a selector |
| `Parallel` | Run branches concurrently |

## [​](#deep-nesting) Deep Nesting

Workflows can be nested to a maximum depth of 10. Nested runs keep their own workflow and run IDs while sharing the parent’s session context for the call.

deeply\_nested.py

```
from agno.workflow import Parallel, Step, StepInput, StepOutput, Workflow

def collect_data(step_input: StepInput) -> StepOutput:
    return StepOutput(content=f"Collected data for {step_input.input}")

def analyze_data(step_input: StepInput) -> StepOutput:
    return StepOutput(content=f"Analysis of {step_input.previous_step_content}")

def collect_opinion(step_input: StepInput) -> StepOutput:
    return StepOutput(content=f"Expert opinion for {step_input.input}")

def merge_results(step_input: StepInput) -> StepOutput:
    return StepOutput(content=f"Merged research:\n{step_input.previous_step_content}")

def write_report(step_input: StepInput) -> StepOutput:
    return StepOutput(content=f"Report:\n{step_input.previous_step_content}")

data_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Data Collection",
    steps=[
        Step(name="gather", executor=collect_data),
        Step(name="analyze", executor=analyze_data),
    ],
)

opinion_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Expert Opinion",
    steps=[Step(name="opinion", executor=collect_opinion)],
)

level2_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Comprehensive Research",
    steps=[
        Parallel(
            Step(name="data_branch", workflow=data_workflow),
            Step(name="opinion_branch", workflow=opinion_workflow),
            name="parallel_research",
        ),
        Step(name="merge", executor=merge_results),
    ],
)

outer_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Full Pipeline",
    steps=[
        Step(name="research", workflow=level2_workflow),
        Step(name="write", executor=write_report),
    ],
)

outer_workflow.print_response("Battery storage markets")
```

## [​](#streaming-events) Streaming Events

When streaming, inner workflow events bubble up with a `nested_depth` field. Use this to distinguish inner vs. outer events.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `nested_depth` | `0` for outer workflow, `1` for first-level inner, `2` for deeper nesting |
| `workflow_id` | ID of the workflow that emitted the event |
| `workflow_name` | Name of the workflow that emitted the event |

Using `outer_workflow` from the deep-nesting example:

```
from agno.run.workflow import (
    StepCompletedEvent,
    StepStartedEvent,
    WorkflowCompletedEvent,
    WorkflowStartedEvent,
)

for event in outer_workflow.run(
    input="Battery storage markets",
    stream=True,
    stream_events=True,
):
    if isinstance(event, (WorkflowStartedEvent, StepStartedEvent)):
        depth = event.nested_depth
        name = event.workflow_name
        print(f"{'  ' * depth}[depth={depth}] {type(event).__name__} from {name}")
```
