# Running Workflows - Agno

Source: https://docs.agno.com/workflows/running-workflows

`Workflow.run()` returns a `WorkflowRunOutput`, or an event iterator when streaming is enabled. The iterator contains workflow events and, by default, events forwarded by agent and team step executors.
`workflow.print_response()` runs the workflow and formats its output in the terminal.

## [​](#running-a-workflow) Running a Workflow

Call `workflow.run()` and capture the result in `response`:

```
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.team import Team
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools
from agno.workflow import Workflow
from agno.run.workflow import WorkflowRunOutput
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

hackernews_agent = Agent(
    name="HackerNews Agent",
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    role="Extract key insights from HackerNews posts",
)
finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Agent",
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools()],
    role="Get stock prices and financial data",
)

research_team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    members=[hackernews_agent, finance_agent],
    instructions="Research tech topics and related stocks",
)

content_planner = Agent(
    name="Content Planner",
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    instructions=[
        "Plan a content schedule over 4 weeks for the provided topic and research content",
        "Schedule three posts per week",
    ],
)

content_creation_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Content Creation Workflow",
    description="Automated content creation from blog posts to social media",
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/workflow.db"),
    steps=[research_team, content_planner],
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    response: WorkflowRunOutput = content_creation_workflow.run(
        input="AI trends in 2026",
    )

    pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
```

Without streaming, `Workflow.run()` returns
[`WorkflowRunOutput`](/reference/workflows/run-output).

## [​](#async-execution) Async Execution

The `Workflow.arun()` function is the async version of `Workflow.run()`.

```

    summary = step_input.previous_step_content or ""

    # Look for keywords that suggest factual claims
    fact_indicators = [
        "study shows",
        "breakthroughs",

    agent=claim_reviewer,
)

    name="write_article",
    description="Write final article",
    agent=writer,
)

basic_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Basic Linear Workflow",
    description="Research -> Summarize -> Condition(Claim Review) -> Write Article",
    steps=[

            evaluator=needs_claim_review,
            steps=[claim_review_step],
        ),
        write_article,
    ],
)

async def main():
    try:
        response: WorkflowRunOutput = await basic_workflow.arun(
            input="Recent breakthroughs in quantum computing",
        )
        pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## [​](#streaming-responses) Streaming Responses

Set `stream=True` to return an event iterator instead of a single response. With `stream_executor_events=True`, the default, the iterator can also contain agent and team events from step executors.

```
# Definitions from the non-streaming example
...

content_creation_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Content Creation Workflow",
    description="Automated content creation from blog posts to social media",
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/workflow.db"),
    steps=[research_team, content_planner],
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    response = content_creation_workflow.run(
        input="AI trends in 2026",
        stream=True,
    )

    pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
```

### [​](#streaming-all-events) Streaming All Events

With `stream_events=False`, the default, the stream still includes the workflow start and completion events, step output events from function executors, and forwarded agent and team events.
Set `stream_events=True` to include workflow lifecycle events for steps, conditions, loops, routers, and parallel groups.

```
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.workflow import Condition, Step, Workflow, StepInput
from agno.run.workflow import WorkflowRunEvent

    ]

    return any(indicator in summary.lower() for indicator in fact_indicators)

research_step = Step(
    name="research",
    description="Research the topic",
    agent=researcher,
)

summarize_step = Step(
    name="summarize",
    description="Summarize research findings",
    agent=summarizer,
)

claim_review_step = Step(
    name="claim_review",
    description="Identify claims requiring source verification",
    agent=claim_reviewer,
)

write_article = Step(
    name="write_article",
    description="Write final article",

    ],
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        response = basic_workflow.run(
            input="Recent breakthroughs in quantum computing",
            stream=True,
            stream_events=True,
        )
        for event in response:
            if event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.condition_execution_started.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.condition_execution_completed.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_started.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.step_started.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.step_completed.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_completed.value:
                print(event)
                print()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        import traceback

        traceback.print_exc()
```

### [​](#streaming-executor-events) Streaming Executor Events

Events from agents and teams inside a workflow are forwarded by default. Set `stream_executor_events=False` to filter their nonterminal events. Executor completion and cancellation events are still forwarded.
Workflow-level events are not affected by this setting. With `stream_events=True`, events such as `WorkflowStarted`, `StepStarted`, `ConditionExecutionStarted`, and their completion events remain in the stream.

```
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIResponses
from agno.workflow import Step, Workflow

agent = Agent(
    name="ResearchAgent",
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-5.2"),
    instructions="You are a helpful research assistant. Be concise.",
)

workflow = Workflow(
    name="Research Workflow",
    steps=[Step(name="Research", agent=agent)],
    stream=True,
    stream_executor_events=False,
)

print("\n" + "=" * 70)
print("Workflow Streaming Example: stream_executor_events=False")
print("=" * 70)
print(
    "\nThis filters nonterminal agent and team events such as RunContent and TeamRunContent."
)
print("Executor completion and cancellation events remain in the stream.\n")

for event in workflow.run(
    "What is Python?",
    stream=True,
    stream_events=True,
):
    event_name = event.event if hasattr(event, "event") else type(event).__name__
    print(f"  → {event_name}")
```

### [​](#async-streaming) Async Streaming

`Workflow.arun(stream=True)` returns an async event iterator instead of a single response. It can include forwarded agent and team events under the same `stream_executor_events` setting.

```
# Define your workflow
...

async def main():
    try:
        response = basic_workflow.arun(
            input="Recent breakthroughs in quantum computing",
            stream=True,
            stream_events=True,
        )
        async for event in response:
            if event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.condition_execution_started.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.condition_execution_completed.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_started.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.step_started.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.step_completed.value:
                print(event)
                print()
            elif event.event == WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_completed.value:
                print(event)
                print()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

See the [Async Streaming](/workflows/usage/async-events-streaming) example for more details.

### [​](#common-event-types) Common Event Types

The following workflow events are commonly yielded by `Workflow.run()` and `Workflow.arun()` when streaming is configured. The event enum also includes pause, continuation, cancellation, review, workflow-agent, and custom events.

#### [​](#core-events) Core Events

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `WorkflowStarted` | Indicates the start of a workflow run |
| `WorkflowCompleted` | Signals successful completion of the workflow run |
| `WorkflowError` | Indicates an error occurred during the workflow run |

#### [​](#step-events) Step Events

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `StepStarted` | Indicates the start of a step |
| `StepCompleted` | Signals successful completion of a step |
| `StepError` | Indicates an error occurred during a step |

#### [​](#step-output-events-for-custom-functions) Step Output Events (For custom functions)

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `StepOutput` | Indicates the output of a step |

#### [​](#parallel-execution-events) Parallel Execution Events

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ParallelExecutionStarted` | Indicates the start of a parallel step |
| `ParallelExecutionCompleted` | Signals successful completion of a parallel step |

#### [​](#condition-execution-events) Condition Execution Events

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ConditionExecutionStarted` | Indicates the start of a condition |
| `ConditionExecutionCompleted` | Signals successful completion of a condition |

#### [​](#loop-execution-events) Loop Execution Events

See the [WorkflowRunOutputEvent](/reference/workflows/run-output) reference.

### [​](#storing-events) Storing Events

Set `store_events=True` to retain generated events on the workflow run. Use `events_to_skip` to exclude selected event types.
Access retained events through `workflow.get_last_run_output().events`. When the workflow has a database, the events are persisted with the run.

- `store_events=True`: Retain events on `WorkflowRunOutput.events`
- `events_to_skip=[...]`: Exclude matching workflow, agent, or team event types

**Available Events to Skip:**

```
from agno.run.workflow import WorkflowRunEvent

# Common events you might want to skip
events_to_skip = [
    WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.workflow_cancelled,
    WorkflowRunEvent.step_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.step_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.parallel_execution_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.parallel_execution_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.condition_execution_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.condition_execution_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.loop_execution_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.loop_execution_completed,
    WorkflowRunEvent.router_execution_started,
    WorkflowRunEvent.router_execution_completed,
]
```

**Use Cases**

- **Debugging**: Inspect workflow control flow
- **Performance analysis**: Compare event timing and step metrics
- **Error investigation**: Review events leading to a failure
- **Persisted run records**: Store selected events when a database is configured

**Configuration Examples**

```
# store everything
debug_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Debug Workflow",
    store_events=True,
    steps=[...]
)

# store only important events
production_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Production Workflow",
    store_events=True,
    events_to_skip=[
        WorkflowRunEvent.step_started,
        WorkflowRunEvent.parallel_execution_started,
        # keep step_completed and workflow_completed
    ],
    steps=[...]
)

# No event storage
fast_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Fast Workflow",
    store_events=False,
    steps=[...]
)
```

[Store workflow events](/workflows/usage/store-events-and-events-to-skip-in-a-workflow).

## [​](#agno-telemetry) Agno Telemetry

Workflow telemetry includes the workflow ID, database type, whether an input schema is configured, the session and run IDs, the SDK version, and the workflow event type. Disable it with `AGNO_TELEMETRY=false` or `telemetry=False`.

```
export AGNO_TELEMETRY=false
```

Or set the option on the workflow:

```
workflow = Workflow(steps=[], telemetry=False)
```

See the [Workflow class reference](/reference/workflows/workflow) for more details.
