# Conditional Workflow - Agno

Source: https://docs.agno.com/workflows/usage/condition-steps-workflow-stream

Use `Condition` to run a step only when the input calls for it. In this workflow, an
evaluator looks at the research summary and decides whether to add a fact-checking step
before the article gets written.
**When to use**: Quality gates or content-specific processing based on an earlier
step’s output.
Install dependencies:

```
uv pip install agno openai
```
