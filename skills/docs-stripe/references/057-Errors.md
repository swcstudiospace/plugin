# Errors
Stripe uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Stripe’s servers (these are rare).
Some `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is [declined](https://docs.stripe.com/declines.md)) include an [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes.md) that briefly explains the error reported.
### HTTP Status Code Summary
| 200 | OK | Everything worked as expected. |
| 400 | Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | No valid API key provided. |
| 402 | Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed. |
| 403 | Forbidden | The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request. |
| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource doesn’t exist. |
| 409 | Conflict | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). |
| 424 | External Dependency Failed | The request couldn’t be completed due to a failure in a dependency external to Stripe. |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
| 500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors | Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.) |
### Error Types
| `api\_error` | API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Stripe’s servers), and are extremely uncommon. |
| `card\_error` | Card errors are the most common type of error you should expect to handle. They result when the user enters a card that can’t be charged for some reason. |
| `idempotency\_error` | Idempotency errors occur when an `Idempotency-Key` is re-used on a request that does not match the first request’s API endpoint and parameters. |
| `invalid\_request\_error` | Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters. |
