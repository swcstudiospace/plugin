### Create a Checkout Session
Add an endpoint on your server that creates a \*Checkout Session\* (A Checkout Session represents your customer's session as they pay for one-time purchases or subscriptions through Checkout. After a successful payment, the Checkout Session contains a reference to the Customer, and either the successful PaymentIntent or an active Subscription), setting the [ui\_mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-ui\_mode) to `embedded\_page`. You must create the Checkout Session server-side because it requires your [secret or restricted API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys), which you can’t safely expose in client-side code.
The Checkout Session response includes a client secret, which the client uses to mount Checkout. Return the [client\_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout\_session\_object-client\_secret) in your response.
### Create a Checkout Session
Add a [Server Action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) to your application that creates a \*Checkout Session\* (A Checkout Session represents your customer's session as they pay for one-time purchases or subscriptions through Checkout. After a successful payment, the Checkout Session contains a reference to the Customer, and either the successful PaymentIntent or an active Subscription), setting the [ui\_mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-ui\_mode) to `embedded\_page`. You must create the Checkout Session server-side because it requires your [secret or restricted API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys), which you can’t safely expose in client-side code.
The Checkout Session response includes a client secret, which the client uses to mount Checkout. Return the [client\_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout\_session\_object-client\_secret) from the function.
### Supply a return URL
To define where Stripe redirects your customer after payment, specify the URL of the return page in the [return\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-return\_url) parameter when creating the Checkout Session. After the payment attempt, Stripe redirects your customer to the return page hosted on your website.
Include the `{CHECKOUT\_SESSION\_ID}` template variable in the URL. Before redirecting your customer, Checkout replaces the variable with the Checkout Session ID. You’re responsible for creating and hosting the return page on your website.
### Define a product to sell
Define the products you’re selling when you create the Checkout Session by using [predefined price IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?payment-ui=checkout&ui=embedded-page#create-product-prices-upfront).
Always keep sensitive information about your product inventory, such as price and availability, on your server to prevent customer manipulation from the client.
### Choose the mode
To handle different transaction types, adjust the `mode` parameter. For one-time payments, use `payment`. To initiate recurring payments with [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions.md?payment-ui=checkout&ui=embedded-page), switch the `mode` to `subscription`. And for [setting up future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse.md?platform=web&ui=embedded-page), set the `mode` to `setup`.
### Add Stripe to your React app
To stay \*PCI compliant\* (Any party involved in processing, transmitting, or storing credit card data must comply with the rules specified in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. PCI compliance is a shared responsibility and applies to both Stripe and your business) by ensuring that payment details go directly to Stripe and never reach your server, install [React Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md).
```bash
npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```
### Load Stripe.js
To configure the Stripe library, call `loadStripe()` with your Stripe publishable API key.
### Load Stripe.js
Use \*Stripe.js\* (Use Stripe.js’ APIs to tokenize customer information, collect sensitive card data, and accept payments with browser payment APIs) to remain \*PCI compliant\* (Any party involved in processing, transmitting, or storing credit card data must comply with the rules specified in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. PCI compliance is a shared responsibility and applies to both Stripe and your business) by ensuring that payment details are sent directly to Stripe without hitting your server. Always load Stripe.js from \*js.stripe.com\* to remain compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host it yourself.
### Define the payment form
To securely collect the customer’s information, create an empty placeholder `div`. Stripe inserts an iframe into the `div`.
### Initialize Stripe.js
Initialize Stripe.js with your [publishable API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys).
### Fetch a Checkout Session client secret
Create an asynchronous `fetchClientSecret` function that makes a request to your server to [create a Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) and retrieve the client secret.
### Fetch a Checkout Session client secret
Import the Server Action to [create a Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) and retrieve the client secret, passing it to the [`fetchClientSecret`](https://docs.stripe.com/js/embedded\_checkout/create#embedded\_checkout\_create-options-fetchClientSecret) parameter.
### Initialize Checkout
Initialize Checkout with your `fetchClientSecret` function and mount it to the placeholder `

` in your payment form. Checkout is rendered in an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection.
Avoid placing Checkout within another iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page for payment confirmation.
### Initialize Checkout
To allow the child components to access the Stripe service through the embedded Checkout consumer, pass the resulting promise from `loadStripe` and the client secret as an `option` to the embedded Checkout provider.
### Create an endpoint to retrieve a Checkout Session
Add an endpoint to retrieve a Checkout Session status.
### Add a return page
To display order information to your customer, create a return page for the URL you provided as the Checkout Session `return\_url`. Stripe redirects to this page after the customer completes the checkout.
### Add a return component
To display order information to your customer, add a new route and return component for the URL you provided as the Checkout Session `return\_url`. Stripe redirects to this page after the customer completes the checkout.
### Add a return page
To display order information to your customer, add a file under `pages/` for the URL you provided as the Checkout Session `return\_url`. Stripe redirects your customer to this page after they check out.
### Retrieve a Checkout session
As soon as your return page loads, immediately make a request to the endpoint on your server. Use the Checkout Session ID in the URL to retrieve the status of the Checkout Session.
### Handle session
Handle the result of the session by using its status:
- `complete`: The payment succeeded. Use the information from the Checkout Session to render a success page.
- `open`: The payment failed or was canceled. Remount Checkout so that your customer can try again.
### Set your environment variables
Add your publishable and secret keys to a `.env` file. Next.js automatically loads them into your application as [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).
Each webhook endpoint has a unique signing secret. Webhooks are managed in [Workbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench.md) in the Dashboard. You can find the secret in the destination detail view for your webhook endpoint in Workbench’s [Webhooks tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks). If you’re testing locally with the Stripe CLI, you can also get the secret from the CLI output using the command `stripe listen`.
To include a webhook endpoint signing secret to listen to [events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md), go to Workbench’s [Event destinations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks) tab or use the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli.md).
### Run the application
Start your server and go to
### Run the application
Start your server and go to
### Run the application
Start your app with `npm run dev` and go to
### Try it out
Click the pay button to complete the payment, which redirects you to the specified return page.
If you see the return page, and the payment in the list of [successful payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments?status%5B0%5D=successful) in the Dashboard, your integration is successfully working. Use any of the following test cards to simulate a payment:
| Scenario | Card Number |
| --- | --- |
| Payment succeeds | 4242424242424242 |
| Payment requires 3DS authentication | 4000002500003155 |
| Payment is declined | 4000000000009995 |
## Congratulations!
You have a basic Checkout integration working. Now learn how to customize the appearance of your checkout page and automate tax collection.
### Customize the checkout page
[Customize](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization.md) the appearance of the embedded form by:
- Adding your color theme and font in your [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding/checkout).
- Using the [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md)to activate additional features, like collecting addresses and prefilling customer data.
### Prefill customer data
Use [customer\_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-customer\_email) to prefill the customer’s email address in the email input field. You can also pass a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) ID to the `customer` field to prefill the email address field with the email stored on the Customer.
### Pick a submit button
Change the text of the submit button to `pay`, `donate`, or `book` by setting the [submit\_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-submit\_type). The default text is `pay`.
### Collect billing and shipping details
Use [billing\_address\_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-billing\_address\_collection) and [shipping\_address\_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-shipping\_address\_collection) to collect your customer’s address. [shipping\_address\_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-shipping\_address\_collection) requires a list of `allowed\_countries`, which Checkout displays in a dropdown menu on the page.
### Automate tax collection
Calculate and collect the right amount of tax on your Stripe transactions. Learn more about [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax.md) and [how to add it to Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout.md).
### Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard
[Activate Stripe Tax](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax) to monitor your tax obligations, automatically collect tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.
### Add the automatic tax parameter
Set the `automatic\_tax` parameter to `enabled: true`.
### Link autofill for returning customers
[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link.md) lets returning customers check out faster by automatically filling in their payment and shipping details. Link is available in embedded Checkout by default. When your customer enters their email address and they have a Link account, they can authenticate with a one-time code to automatically fill their saved details.
### New and returning customers
By default, Checkout only creates [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) when one is required (for example, for subscriptions). Otherwise, Checkout uses [guest customers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/guest-customers.md) to group payments in the Dashboard. You can optionally configure Checkout to always create a new customer or to specify a returning customer.
### Always create customers
To always create customers whenever one isn’t provided, set [customer\_creation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-customer\_creation) to `'always'`.
### Specify returning customers
To associate a Checkout Session with a customer that already exists, provide the [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-customer) when creating a session. If you represent customers as customer-configured Account objects, you can also pass an Account ID to the [customer\_account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create\_checkout\_session-customer\_account) field to prefill the associated email address. Learn more about the [difference between using v1 Customers and v2 Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/accounts-v2/use-accounts-as-customers.md).
