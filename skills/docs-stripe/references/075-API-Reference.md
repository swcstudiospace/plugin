The Stripe API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational\_State\_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST\_\(HTTP\)#Use\_for\_submitting\_web\_forms) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
You can use the Stripe API in [sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes.md) without affecting your live data or interacting with banking networks. The API key that you use to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/authentication.md) the request determines whether the request runs in live mode or in a sandbox. Sandboxes support all v2 APIs. Test mode sandboxes support some [v2 APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/testing-use-cases.md#compare).
The Stripe API doesn’t support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.
The Stripe API differs for every account as we release new [versions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning.md) and tailor functionality. Log in to see docs with your test key and data.
