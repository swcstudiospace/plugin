# Resolve webhook signature verification errors
Learn how to fix a common error when listening to webhook events.
When processing webhook events, we recommend securing your endpoint by [verifying](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#verify-official-libraries) that the event is coming from Stripe. To do this, use the `Stripe-Signature` header and call the `constructEvent()` function with three parameters:
- `requestBody`: The request body string sent by Stripe.
- `signature`: The Stripe-Signature header in the request sent by Stripe.
- `endpointSecret`: The secret associated with your endpoint.
This function might look like this:
#### Ruby
```ruby
Stripe::Webhook.construct\_event(request\_body, signature, endpoint\_secret)
```
If you get the following `Webhook signature verification failed` error, at least one of the three parameters you passed to the `constructEvent()` function is incorrect.
```
Webhook signature verification failed. Err: No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload.
```
## Check the endpoint secret
The most common error is using the wrong endpoint secret. If you’re using a webhook endpoint created in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks), open the endpoint in the Dashboard and click the \*\*Reveal secret\*\* link near the top of the page to view the secret. If you’re using the Stripe CLI, the secret is printed in the Terminal when you run the `stripe listen` command.
In both cases, the secret starts with a `whsec\_` prefix, but the secret itself is different. Don’t verify signatures on events forwarded by the CLI using the secret from a Dashboard-managed endpoint, or the other way around. Finally, print the `endpointSecret` used in your code, and make sure that it matches the one you found above.
## Check the request body
The request body must be the body string that Stripe sends in UTF-8 encoding without any changes. When you print it as a string, it looks similar to this:
```
{
"id": "evt\_xxx",
"object": "event",
"data": {
...
}
}
```
### Retrieve the raw request body
Some frameworks might edit the request body by doing things like adding or removing whitespace, reordering the key-value pairs, converting the string to JSON, or changing the encoding. All of these cases lead to a failed signature verification.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of frameworks that might parse or mutate the data using common configurations, and some tips on how to get the raw request body.
| Framework | Retrieval method |
| --- | --- |
| stripe-node library with Express | Follow our [integration quickstart guide](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart.md?lang=node). |
| stripe-node library with Body Parser | Try solutions listed in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/issues/341). |
| stripe-node library with Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) | Take a look at this [working example](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/blob/master/examples/webhook-signing/nextjs/app/api/webhooks/route.ts). |
| stripe-node library with Next.js [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) | Try disabling `bodyParser` and using `buffer(request)`, like in [this example](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/blob/master/examples/webhook-signing/nextjs/pages/api/webhooks.ts). |
If you’re using the stripe-node library with Express, make sure that `app.use(express.json())` is placed \*after\* the webhook route. In Express, the order of middleware configuration matters. If `express.json()` is applied before your webhook route, it parses the request body before signature verification, causing the verification to fail. For example:
```javascript
// Webhook route in its original request form
app.post('/webhook', ...);
// Parse the request body in JSON for other routes
app.use(express.json());
// Put other routes here
app.post('/another-route', ...);
```
### AWS API Gateway with Lambda function
To retrieve the raw request body for the AWS API Gateway with Lambda function, in the API Gateway, set up a \*\*Body Mapping Template\*\* of content type `application/json`:
```
{
"method": "$context.httpMethod",
"body": $input.json('$'),
"rawBody": "$util.escapeJavaScript($input.body).replaceAll("\\'", "'")",
"headers": {
#foreach($param in $input.params().header.keySet())
"$param": "$util.escapeJavaScript($input.params().header.get($param))"
#if($foreach.hasNext),#end
#end
}
}
```
Then, in the Lambda function, access the raw body with the event’s `rawBody` property and the headers with the event’s `headers` property.
## Check the signature
Print the `signature` parameter, and confirm that it looks similar to this:
```
t=xxx,v1=yyy,v0=zzz
```
If not, check if you have an issue in your code when trying to extract the signature from the header.
