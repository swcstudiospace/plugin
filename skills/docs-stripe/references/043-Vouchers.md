# Vouchers
Learn about voucher payment methods with Stripe.
Voucher payment methods are different from gift vouchers. If you want to issue gift vouchers, try promos and discounts with [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/discounts.md).
With vouchers, customers complete online purchases in-person at authorized locations such as convenience stores. Vouchers are often used by:
- Businesses with customers that don’t have cards or bank accounts.
- Retailers with consumers in countries such as Mexico, where card authorizations rates are low and offering a backup payment option improves conversion.
Vouchers might not be a good fit for your business if:
- You deliver goods immediately after checkout. Some customers might not complete payment and it can take 1 business day to receive a payment confirmation.
- You need to send refunds. Not all vouchers support refunds. Some businesses create separate processes to credit customers who ask for a refund directly.
## Payment flow
When a customer chooses a voucher method for payment, they receive a digital voucher through email or in an app with a transaction summary and a voucher code. The customer scans the voucher code at an authorized location like a convenience store and pays in-person, often with cash.
![Figure describing the four step voucher payment flow. First, customer selects voucher payment at checkout. Next, they receive a voucher with transaction reference. Then, they provide voucher and cash at a store, ATM, or bank. Finally, receive notification that payment is complete.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment\_flow.3f6e339397147be5fa542edec11d7060.svg)
