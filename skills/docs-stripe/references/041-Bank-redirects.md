# Bank redirects
Learn about bank redirects with Stripe.
Bank redirects let customers pay online using their bank account. They drive more than half of online commerce in Germany, the Netherlands, and Malaysia. Bank redirects are often used by:
- Retailers that want to improve conversion and reduce fraud with consumers in Europe and Asia Pacific.
- Software or service businesses collecting one-time payments from other businesses.
Some bank redirects support \*subscriptions\* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis) and recurring payments. See the product support table below for details on which payment methods support subscriptions.
## Payment flow
At checkout, the customer is redirected to their online banking portal, logs in with their bank credentials, approves the transaction, and then returns to your site. Some bank redirects verify the user through SMS or other two-factor authentication for additional security.

## Product support
We’ve created a single integration for all bank redirects that works across Stripe products. With [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout.md), you can add any bank redirect by changing one line of code.

All other payment method types either don’t support `setup\_future\_usage` or only support `off\_session`.2 Payment methods might require confirmation with [return\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment\_intents/confirm.md#confirm\_payment\_intent-return\_url) to indicate where Stripe should redirect your customer after they complete the payment.3 BLIK doesn’t support the [deferred intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred.md) creation integration path.
