# Using GitHub Copilot code review

Learn how to request a code review from GitHub Copilot.

## Tool navigation

## [Introduction](#introduction)

GitHub Copilot can review your code and provide feedback. Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

For a full introduction to GitHub Copilot code review, see [About GitHub Copilot code review](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review).

Copilot code review uses GitHub Actions to run agentic capabilities. For more information, see [Agentic capabilities for Copilot code review](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review#usage-of-github-actions-runners-for-agentic-capabilities-in-code-review).

Copilot code review is also available for organization members without a Copilot license, when enabled by an enterprise administrator or organization owner. See [Copilot code review for organization members without a Copilot license](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review#copilot-code-review-without-a-copilot-license).

## [Using Copilot code review](#using-copilot-code-review)

These instructions explain how to use Copilot code review in the GitHub website. To see instructions for other popular coding environments, click the appropriate tab at the top of the page.

1. On GitHub.com, create a pull request or navigate to an existing pull request.
2. Under "Reviewers" in the right sidebar, next to **Copilot**, click **Request**.

   ![Screenshot of Copilot with 'Request' button under 'Reviewers'.](/assets/cb-22907/images/help/copilot/code-review/request-review@2x.png)
3. Wait for Copilot to review your pull request. This usually takes less than 30 seconds.
4. Scroll down and read through Copilot's comments.

   ![Screenshot of a code review left by Copilot.](/assets/cb-418307/images/help/copilot/code-review/review-comment@2x.png)

   Copilot always leaves a "Comment" review, not an "Approve" review or a "Request changes" review. This means that Copilot's reviews do not count toward required approvals for the pull request, and Copilot's reviews will not block merging changes. For more details, see [Approving a pull request with required reviews](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews).
5. Copilot's review comments behave like review comments from humans. You can add reactions to them, comment on them, resolve them and hide them.

   Any comments you add to Copilot's review comments will be visible to humans, but they won't be visible to Copilot, and Copilot won't reply.

You can also request a review from Copilot through the GitHub REST API by requesting `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` as a reviewer. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for review requests](/en/rest/pulls/review-requests#request-reviewers-for-a-pull-request).

## [Enabling automatic reviews](#enabling-automatic-reviews)

By default, you manually request a review from Copilot on each pull request, in the same way you would request a review from a human. However, you can set up Copilot to automatically review all pull requests. See [Configuring automatic code review by GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/set-up-copilot/configure-automatic-review).

## [Working with suggested changes provided by Copilot](#working-with-suggested-changes-provided-by-copilot)

Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

If you're happy with the changes, you can accept a single suggestion from Copilot and commit it, or accept a group of suggestions together in a single commit. For more information, see [Incorporating feedback in your pull request](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request).

You can also invoke Copilot cloud agent to implement suggested changes. To do this, you must:

- Enable GitHub Copilot code review and Copilot cloud agent.
- On review comments from GitHub Copilot code review, click **Fix with Copilot**. This creates a draft comment on the pull request, where you can instruct Copilot to address specific feedback. You can then select whether Copilot will create a new pull request against your branch or a commit to the same pull request with the suggestions applied.

## [Requesting a re-review from Copilot](#requesting-a-re-review-from-copilot)

When you push changes to a pull request that Copilot has reviewed, it won't automatically re-review your changes unless you've configured it to review new pushes after enabling automatic reviews.

To manually request a re-review from Copilot, click the button next to Copilot's name in the **Reviewers** menu. For more information, see [Requesting a pull request review](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).

To automatically request re-reviews from Copilot on every push, enable automatic code review for the repository and select **Review new pushes** in the ruleset settings. For more information, see [Configuring automatic code review by GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/set-up-copilot/configure-automatic-review#configuring-automatic-code-review-for-repositories-in-an-organization).

Note

When re-reviewing a pull request, Copilot may repeat the same comments again, even if they have been dismissed with the "Resolve conversation" button or downvoted with the thumbs down (👎) button.

## [Customizing Copilot's reviews with custom instructions](#customizing-copilots-reviews-with-custom-instructions)

You can customize Copilot code review by adding custom instructions to your repository. Repository custom instructions can either be repository wide or path specific.

Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repository-wide review guidance that should apply across the entire codebase. This is a good place to describe organization-wide expectations, such as coding standards, review criteria, or general practices that Copilot should consider in every review.

Use an `AGENTS.md` file in the root of your repository to provide additional repository context that helps Copilot better understand how your project works. For example, you can explain which patterns are intentional, which parts of the codebase need closer scrutiny, and what your team considers good architecture, testing, and implementation practices. This helps make reviews more relevant and aligned with the way your team builds software.

Use `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` files for path-specific instructions that only apply when reviewing matching files. This is useful when different parts of the repository follow different conventions, require specialized checks, or need review guidance tailored to a particular language, framework, or subsystem.

For more information, see [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions).

Note

When reviewing a pull request, Copilot reads repository custom instructions, agent instructions, and agent skills from the head branch (the branch with your changes), not the base branch. For example, when merging `my-feature-branch` into `main`, Copilot uses the instructions and skills in `my-feature-branch`, so you can test changes to them in the same pull request without merging them first.

### [Example](#example)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be applied to all Copilot code reviews in the repository.

```
When performing a code review, respond in Spanish.

When performing a code review, apply the checks in the `/security/security-checklist.md` file.

When performing a code review, focus on readability and avoid nested ternary operators.
```

## [MCP servers and agent skills](#mcp-servers-and-agent-skills)

Note

Support for agent skills and MCP servers with Copilot code review is in public preview and subject to change.

Copilot code review can use agent skills and MCP servers configured in the repository, when they are relevant to the code being reviewed.

To make these available for Copilot code review on GitHub, configure:

- **Agent skills** in your repository (in `.github/skills`). If you want a skill to target review tasks, use a review-focused skill directory name such as `code-review`. For setup details, see [Adding agent skills for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/add-skills).
- **MCP servers** in repository Copilot settings. The GitHub MCP server and Playwright MCP server are enabled by default. For setup details, see [Configure MCP servers for your repository](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/configure-mcp-servers).

Copilot code review is more likely to use this context when:

- Agent skills directories have review-focused names and descriptions, such as `code-review`, that indicate they are intended for pull request review.
- Your agent skills or custom instructions explicitly tell Copilot code review to use specific MCP context.
- Pull request descriptions reference items available through configured MCP servers, such as issue keys or incident IDs.

To verify which MCP context Copilot code review used for a specific review, open the linked review session from the pull request timeline, then check the session logs to see which MCP servers and tools were called.

In repository settings, **Allow Copilot to use MCP tools when reviewing pull requests** is enabled by default. Disable this setting if you want MCP servers available only for Copilot cloud agent, and not for Copilot code review. For step-by-step instructions, see [Configure MCP servers for your repository](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/configure-mcp-servers#disabling-mcp-tools-for-code-review).

## [Customizing Copilot code review's environment](#customizing-copilot-code-reviews-environment)

Copilot code review runs in an ephemeral development environment, similar to Copilot cloud agent. You can customize this environment using a GitHub Actions workflow file, in the same way you would for Copilot cloud agent, for example, to preinstall tools or dependencies, or to switch to a different operating system. For more information on how to structure this file, see [Configure the development environment](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/customize-the-agent-environment).

You can use either of the following files to configure Copilot code review's environment:

- `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`: If you have already configured this file for Copilot cloud agent, Copilot code review will use the same configuration by default.
- `.github/workflows/copilot-code-review.yml`: We recommend creating this file if you want to configure Copilot code review's environment independently of Copilot cloud agent. If this file is present in your repository, it is used for Copilot code review instead of `copilot-setup-steps.yml`.

You can also configure firewall rules to control the domains and URLs that Copilot code review can access, at both the organization and repository level. These settings are configured separately from Copilot cloud agent's firewall settings, in their own section of the same "Internet access" tab. See [Customizing or disabling the firewall for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/customize-the-agent-firewall).

## [Providing feedback on Copilot's reviews](#providing-feedback-on-copilots-reviews)

## [Customizing Copilot's reviews with custom instructions](#customizing-copilots-reviews-with-custom-instructions-1)

You can customize Copilot code review by adding custom instructions to your repository. Repository custom instructions can either be repository wide or path specific.

Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repository-wide review guidance that should apply across the entire codebase. This is a good place to describe organization-wide expectations, such as coding standards, review criteria, or general practices that Copilot should consider in every review.

Use an `AGENTS.md` file in the root of your repository to provide additional repository context that helps Copilot better understand how your project works. For example, you can explain which patterns are intentional, which parts of the codebase need closer scrutiny, and what your team considers good architecture, testing, and implementation practices. This helps make reviews more relevant and aligned with the way your team builds software.

Use `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` files for path-specific instructions that only apply when reviewing matching files. This is useful when different parts of the repository follow different conventions, require specialized checks, or need review guidance tailored to a particular language, framework, or subsystem.

For more information, see [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions).

Note

When reviewing a pull request, Copilot reads repository custom instructions, agent instructions, and agent skills from the head branch (the branch with your changes), not the base branch. For example, when merging `my-feature-branch` into `main`, Copilot uses the instructions and skills in `my-feature-branch`, so you can test changes to them in the same pull request without merging them first.

### [Example](#example-1)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be applied to all Copilot code reviews in the repository.

```
When performing a code review, respond in Spanish.

When performing a code review, apply the checks in the `/security/security-checklist.md` file.

When performing a code review, focus on readability and avoid nested ternary operators.
