# Asking GitHub Copilot questions in your IDE

Use Copilot Chat in your editor to give you code suggestions, explain code, generate unit tests, and suggest code fixes.

## Tool navigation

## [Introduction](#introduction)

This guide describes how to use Copilot Chat and agents to automate coding tasks by breaking them into steps, using tools to read files, edit code, and run commands, and self-correcting when something goes wrong. You can also ask general questions about software development, or specific questions about the code in your project. For more information, see [About GitHub Copilot Chat](/en/copilot/concepts/chat).

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- **Access to GitHub Copilot**. See [What is GitHub Copilot?](/en/copilot/get-started/what-is-github-copilot#get-access).
- **Latest version of Visual Studio Code**. See the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download?ref_product=copilot&ref_type=engagement&ref_style=text).
- **Sign in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code**. If you experience authentication issues, see [Troubleshooting common issues with GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/troubleshoot-copilot/troubleshoot-common-issues#authentication-problems-in-visual-studio-code).

If you have access to GitHub Copilot via your organization, you won't be able to use GitHub Copilot Chat if your organization owner has disabled chat. See [Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your organization](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/manage-policies).

Note

If you don’t see the **Agent** option in the mode selector, your enterprise or organization administrator may have disabled agent mode for your IDE.

## [Copilot Chat agents](#copilot-chat-agents)

You can use Copilot Chat in the following modes:

- [Agent mode](#agent-mode): to get Copilot to autonomously accomplish a set task.
- [Plan mode](#plan-mode): to get Copilot to create detailed implementation plans to ensure all requirements are met.
- [Ask mode](#ask-mode): to get answers to coding questions and get Copilot to provide code suggestions.

To switch between modes, use the agents dropdown at the bottom of the chat view.

### [Agent mode](#agent-mode)

Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable Copilot to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, Copilot determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete.

Agent mode is best suited to use cases where:

- Your task is complex, and involves multiple steps, iterations, and error handling.
- You want Copilot to determine the necessary steps to take to complete the task.
- The task requires Copilot to integrate with external applications, such as an MCP server.

#### [Using agents](#using-agents)

1. If the chat view is not already displayed, select **Open Chat** from the Copilot Chat menu.
2. At the bottom of the chat view, ensure **Agent** is selected from the agents dropdown.
3. Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot streams the edits in the editor, updates the working set, and if necessary, runs terminal commands, if necessary.
4. Review and iterate on changes or run a code review.

You can also [click this link](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=agent&ref_product=copilot&ref_type=engagement&ref_style=text) to go directly to agent mode in VS Code.

For more information, see [Chat overview](https://aka.ms/vscode-copilot-agent) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

When you use agent mode, each prompt you enter consumes GitHub AI Credits.

#### [Using subagents](#using-subagents)

You can use subagents to delegate tasks to an isolated agent with its own context window within your chat session. The subagent operates independently without pausing for user feedback and returns the final result to the main chat session.

Subagents are best suited for situations where:

- You want to delegate complex, multi-step tasks like research or analysis without interrupting your main session.
- You need to process large amounts of information or multiple documents that would clutter your primary context window.
- You want to explore different approaches or perspectives independently without mixing contexts together.

Subagents use the same tools and AI model as the main session, but they cannot create other subagents.

#### [Enabling subagents](#enabling-subagents)

1. In the Copilot Chat window, click the tools icon.
2. Enable the `runSubagent` tool.

If you use custom prompt files or custom agents, ensure you specify the `runSubagent` tool in the `tools` frontmatter property. See [Creating custom agents for Copilot cloud agent](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/create-custom-agents#configuring-an-agent-profile), and [Use prompt files in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

#### [Invoking subagents](#invoking-subagents)

Subagents can be invoked in different ways:

- **Automatic delegation**. Copilot will analyze the description of your request, the description field of your configured custom agents, and the current context and available tools to automatically choose a subagent. For example, this prompt would automatically delegate the task to a **refactor-specialist** custom agent:

  ```
  Suggest ways to refactor this legacy code.
  ```
- **Direct invocation**. You can directly call the subagent in your prompt:

  ```
  Use the testing subagent to write unit tests for the authentication module.
  ```
- **Calling the #runSubagent tool.**

  ```
  Evaluate the #file:databaseSchema using #runSubagent and generate an optimized data-migration plan.
  ```

When the subagent completes its task, its results appear back in the main chat session, ready for follow-up questions or next steps.

### [Plan mode](#plan-mode)

Plan mode helps you to create detailed implementation plans before executing them. This ensures that all requirements are considered and addressed before any code changes are made. The plan agent does not make any code changes until the plan is reviewed and approved by you. Once approved, you can hand off the plan to the default agent or save it for further refinement, review, or team discussions.

The plan agent is designed to:

- Research the task comprehensively using read-only tools and codebase analysis to identify requirements and constraints.
- Break down the task into manageable, actionable steps and include open questions about ambiguous requirements.
- Present a concise plan draft, based on a standardized plan format, for user review and iteration.

#### [Using the plan agent](#using-the-plan-agent)

1. If the chat view is not already displayed, select **Open Chat** from the Copilot Chat menu.
2. At the bottom of the chat view, select **Plan** from the agents dropdown.
3. Type a prompt that describes a task, such as adding a feature to an existing application, refactoring code, fixing a bug, or creating an initial version of a new application.

   For example: `Create a simple to-do web app with HTML, CSS, and JS files.`

   After a few moments, the plan agent outputs a plan in the chat view. The plan provides a high-level summary and a breakdown of steps, including any open questions for clarification.
4. Review the plan and answer any questions the agent has asked.

   You can iterate multiple times to clarify requirements, adjust scope, or answer questions.
5. Once the plan is complete you can:

   - Click **Start Implementation** to switch Copilot Chat to agent mode and start an agent session to implement the required changes, based on the implementation plan.
   - Click **Open in Editor** to switch Copilot Chat to agent mode and start an agent session that generates Markdown, in a tab of your editor, with the details of the implementation plan. You can start to work through the plan yourself, or save the plan as a Markdown file for later use.

For more information, see [Planning with agents in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/planning) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

### [Ask mode](#ask-mode)

Ask mode is optimized for answering questions about your codebase, coding, and general technology concepts. Use ask mode when you want to understand how something works, explore ideas, or get help with coding tasks.

#### [Using the ask agent](#using-the-ask-agent)

1. If the chat view is not already displayed, select **Open Chat** from the Copilot Chat menu.
2. At the bottom of the chat view, select **Ask** from the agents dropdown.
3. Type a prompt in the prompt box and press `Enter`.

## [Submitting prompts](#submitting-prompts)

You can give the agent a high-level description of what you want to build and it gets to work. Each task runs inside an agent session, a persistent conversation you can track, pause, resume, or hand off to another agent.

1. To open the chat view, click the chat icon in the title bar of Visual Studio Code. If the chat icon is not displayed, right-click the title bar and make sure that **Command Center** is selected.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Copilot Chat' button, highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/cb-24261/images/help/copilot/vsc-copilot-chat-icon.png)
2. Enter a prompt in the prompt box. For an introduction to the kinds of prompts you can use, see [Getting started with prompts for GitHub Copilot Chat in your IDE](/en/copilot/how-tos/chat-with-copilot/get-started-with-chat-in-your-ide).
3. Evaluate Copilot's response, and make a follow-up request if needed.

   The response may contain text, code blocks, buttons, images, URIs, and file trees. The response often includes interactive elements. For example, the response may include a menu to insert a code block, or a button to invoke a Visual Studio Code command.

   To see the files that Copilot Chat used to generate the response, select the **Used *n* references** dropdown at the top of the response. The references may include a link to a custom instructions file for your repository. This file contains additional information that is automatically added to all of your chat questions to improve the quality of the responses. For more information, see [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions).

## [Using keywords in your prompt](#using-keywords-in-your-prompt)

You can use special keywords to help Copilot understand your prompt. For examples, see [Getting started with prompts for GitHub Copilot Chat in your IDE](/en/copilot/how-tos/chat-with-copilot/get-started-with-chat-in-your-ide).

### [Chat participants](#chat-participants)

Chat participants are like domain experts who have a specialty that they can help you with.

Copilot Chat can infer relevant chat participants based on your natural language prompt, improving discovery of advanced capabilities without you having to explicitly specify the participant you want to use in your prompt.

Note

Automatic inference for chat participants is currently in public preview and is subject to change.

Alternatively, you can manually specify a chat participant to scope your prompt to a specific domain. To do this, type `@` in the chat prompt box, followed by a chat participant name.

For a list of available chat participants, type `@` in the chat prompt box. See also [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](/en/copilot/reference/chat-cheat-sheet?tool=vscode#chat-participants) or [Chat participants](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_chat-participants) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

### [Slash commands](#slash-commands)

Use slash commands to avoid writing complex prompts for common scenarios. To use a slash command, type `/` in the chat prompt box, followed by a command.

To see all available slash commands, type `/` in the chat prompt box. See also [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](/en/copilot/reference/chat-cheat-sheet?tool=vscode#slash-commands) or [Slash commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/copilot-vscode-features#_slash-commands) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

### [Chat variables](#chat-variables)

Use chat variables to include specific context in your prompt. To use a chat variable, type `#` in the chat prompt box, followed by a chat variable.

To see all available chat variables, type `#` in the chat prompt box. See also [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](/en/copilot/reference/chat-cheat-sheet?tool=vscode#chat-variables).

## [Using GitHub skills for Copilot](#using-github-skills-for-copilot)

Copilot's GitHub-specific skills expand the type of information Copilot can provide. To access these skills in Copilot Chat, include `@github` in your question.

When you add `@github` to a question, Copilot dynamically selects an appropriate skill, based on the content of your question. You can also explicitly ask Copilot Chat to use a particular skill. You can do this in two ways:

- Use natural language to ask Copilot Chat to use a skill. For example, `@github Search the web to find the latest GPT model from OpenAI.`
- To specifically invoke a web search you can include the `#web` variable in your question. For example, `@github #web What is the latest LTS of Node.js?`

You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking Copilot: `@github What skills are available?`

You can use MCP to extend the capabilities of Copilot Chat by integrating it with a wide range of existing tools and services. For additional information, see [About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/en/copilot/concepts/context/mcp).

## [AI models for Copilot Chat](#ai-models-for-copilot-chat)

You can change the model Copilot uses to generate responses. You may find that different models perform better, or provide more useful responses, depending on the type of questions you ask. Options include premium models with advanced capabilities.

## [Additional ways to access Copilot Chat](#additional-ways-to-access-copilot-chat)

In addition to submitting prompts through the chat view, you can submit prompts in other ways:

- **Quick chat:** To open the quick chat dropdown, enter `Shift`+`Optin`+`Command`+`L` (Mac) / `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Alt`+`L` (Windows/Linux).
- **Inline:** To start an inline chat directly in the editor or integrated terminal, enter `Command`+`i` (Mac) / `Ctrl`+`i` (Windows/Linux).
- **Smart actions:** To submit prompts via the context menu, right click in your editor, select **Copilot** in the menu that appears, then select one of the actions. Smart actions can also be accessed via the sparkle icon that sometimes appears when you select a line of code.

See [inline chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_inline-chat), [quick chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_quick-chat), and [chat smart actions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_chat-smart-actions) in the Visual Studio Code documentation for more details.

## [Using images in Copilot Chat](#using-images-in-copilot-chat)

You can attach images and PDFs to your prompts when using a model that supports image input.

Copilot supports the following file types:

- JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
- PNG (`.png`)
- GIF (`.gif`)
- WEBP (`.webp`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- HEIC (`.heic`)
- HEIF (`.heif`)

For example, you can attach:

   ![Screenshot of the GitHub Copilot Chat icon in the Activity Bar.](/assets/cb-37277/images/help/copilot/jetbrains-copilot-chat-icon.png)
2. Enter a prompt in the prompt box. For example prompts, see [Getting started with prompts for GitHub Copilot Chat in your IDE](/en/copilot/how-tos/chat-with-copilot/get-started-with-chat-in-your-ide).
3. Evaluate Copilot's response, and submit a follow up prompt if needed.

   The response often includes interactive elements. For example, the response may include buttons to copy or insert a code block.

   To see the files that Copilot Chat used to generate the response, click the **References** link below the response. The references may include a link to a custom instructions file for your repository. This file contains additional information that is automatically added to all of your chat questions to improve the quality of the responses. For more information, see [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions).

## [Supplementing your prompt](#supplementing-your-prompt)

You can use slash commands and file references to help Copilot understand your what you are asking it to do.

### [Slash commands](#slash-commands-2)

Use slash commands to avoid writing complex prompts for common scenarios. To use a slash command, type `/` in the chat prompt box, followed by a command.

To see all available slash commands, type `/` in the chat prompt box. See also [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](/en/copilot/reference/chat-cheat-sheet?tool=jetbrains#slash-commands-2).

### [File references](#file-references)

By default, Copilot Chat will reference the file that you have open or the code that you have selected. You can also tell Copilot Chat which files to reference by dragging a file into the chat prompt box. Alternatively, you can right click on a file, select **GitHub Copilot**, then select **Reference File in Chat**.

## [Using GitHub skills for Copilot](#using-github-skills-for-copilot-1)

Copilot's GitHub-specific skills expand the type of information Copilot can provide. To access these skills in Copilot Chat, include `@github` in your question.

When you add `@github` to a question, Copilot dynamically selects an appropriate skill, based on the content of your question. You can also explicitly ask Copilot Chat to use a particular skill. You can do this in two ways:

- Use natural language to ask Copilot Chat to use a skill. For example, `@github Search the web to find the latest GPT model from OpenAI.`
- To specifically invoke a web search you can include the `#web` variable in your question. For example, `@github #web What is the latest LTS of Node.js?`

You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking Copilot: `@github What skills are available?`

You can use MCP to extend the capabilities of Copilot Chat by integrating it with a wide range of existing tools and services. For additional information, see [About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/en/copilot/concepts/context/mcp).

## [AI models for Copilot Chat](#ai-models-for-copilot-chat-2)

You can change the model Copilot uses to generate responses. You may find that different models perform better, or provide more useful responses, depending on the type of questions you ask. Options include premium models with advanced capabilities.

## [Additional ways to access Copilot Chat](#additional-ways-to-access-copilot-chat-2)

- **Built-in requests**. In addition to submitting prompts through the chat window, you can submit built-in requests by right clicking in a file, selecting **GitHub Copilot**, then selecting one of the options.
- **Inline**. You can submit a chat prompt inline, and scope it to a highlighted code block or your current file.
  - To start an inline chat, right click on a code block or anywhere in your current file, hover over **GitHub Copilot**, then select  **Copilot: Inline Chat**, or enter `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I`.

## [Copilot Edits](#copilot-edits-1)

Use Copilot Edits to make changes across multiple files directly from a single Copilot Chat prompt. Copilot Edits has the following modes:

- [Edit mode](#edit-mode-1) lets Copilot make controlled edits to multiple files.
- [Agent mode](#agent-mode-1) lets Copilot autonomously accomplish a set task.

### [Edit mode](#edit-mode)

Edit mode is only available in Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IDEs.

Use edit mode when you want more granular control over the edits that Copilot proposes. In edit mode, you choose which files Copilot can make changes to, provide context to Copilot with each iteration, and decide whether or not to accept the suggested edits after each turn.

Edit mode is best suited to use cases where:

- You want to make a quick, specific update to a defined set of files.
- You want full control over the number of LLM requests Copilot uses.

#### [Using edit mode](#using-edit-mode)

1. To start an edit session, click  **Copilot** in the menu bar, then select **Open GitHub Copilot Chat**.
2. At the top of the chat panel, click **Copilot Edits**.
3. Add relevant files to the *working set* to indicate to GitHub Copilot which files you want to work on. You can add all open files by clicking **Add all open files** or individually search for single files.
4. Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot Edits determines which files in your *working set* to change and adds a short description of the change.
5. Review the changes and **Accept** or **Discard** the edits for each file.

### [Agent mode](#agent-mode-1)

Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable Copilot to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, Copilot determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete.

Agent mode is best suited to use cases where:

- Your task is complex, and involves multiple steps, iterations, and error handling.
- You want Copilot to determine the necessary steps to take to complete the task.
- The task requires Copilot to integrate with external applications, such as an MCP server.

#### [Using agent mode](#using-agent-mode-1)

1. To start an edit session using agent mode, click  **Copilot** in the menu bar, then select **Open GitHub Copilot Chat**.
2. At the top of the chat panel, click the **Agent** tab.
3. Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot streams the edits in the editor, updates the working set, and if necessary, suggests terminal commands to run.
4. Review the changes. If Copilot suggested terminal commands, confirm whether or not Copilot can run them. In response, Copilot iterates and performs additional actions to complete the task in your original prompt.

When you use agent mode, each prompt you enter consumes GitHub AI Credits.

### [Using subagents](#using-subagents-1)

You can use subagents to delegate tasks to an isolated agent with its own context window within your chat session. The subagent operates independently without pausing for user feedback and returns the final result to the main chat session.

Subagents are best suited for situations where:

- You want to delegate complex, multi-step tasks like research or analysis without interrupting your main session.
- You need to process large amounts of information or multiple documents that would clutter your primary context window.
- You want to explore different approaches or perspectives independently without mixing contexts together.

Subagents use the same tools and AI model as the main session, but they cannot create other subagents.

To use subagents, you **must have custom agents configured in your environment**. See [Creating custom agents for Copilot cloud agent](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/create-custom-agents).

#### [Enabling subagents](#enabling-subagents-1)

To enable subagents:

1. Click **Tools** in the menu bar, then click **GitHub Copilot**, then **Edit Settings**.
2. In the popup menu, click **Chat**, then click the **Enable Subagent** checkbox.

#### [Invoking subagents](#invoking-subagents-1)

Subagents can be invoked in different ways:

- **Automatic delegation**. Copilot will analyze the description of your request, the description field of your configured custom agents, and the current context and available tools to automatically choose a subagent. For example, this prompt would automatically delegate the task to a **refactor-specialist** custom agent:

  ```
  Suggest ways to refactor this legacy code.
  ```
- **Direct invocation**. You can directly call the subagent in your prompt:

  ```
  Use the testing subagent to write unit tests for the authentication module.
  ```

When the subagent completes its task, its results appear back in the main chat session, ready for follow-up questions or next steps.

## [Using plan mode](#using-plan-mode)

Plan mode helps you to create detailed implementation plans before executing them. This ensures that all requirements are considered and addressed before any code changes are made. The plan agent does not make any code changes until the plan is reviewed and approved by you. Once approved, you can hand off the plan to the default agent or save it for further refinement, review, or team discussions.

The plan agent is designed to:

- Research the task comprehensively using read-only tools and codebase analysis to identify requirements and constraints.
- Break down the task into manageable, actionable steps and include open questions about ambiguous requirements.
- Present a concise plan draft, based on a standardized plan format, for user review and iteration.

To use plan mode:

1. If it is not already displayed, open the Copilot Chat panel by clicking the **GitHub Copilot Chat** icon at the right side of the JetBrains IDE window.
2. At the bottom of the Copilot Chat panel, select **Plan** from the agents dropdown.
3. Type a prompt that describes a task, such as adding a feature to an existing application, refactoring code, fixing a bug, or creating an initial version of a new application.

   For example: `Create a simple to-do web app with HTML, CSS, and JS files.`
4. Submit the prompt.

   After a few moments, the plan agent outputs a plan in the chat panel. The plan provides a high-level summary and a breakdown of steps, including any open questions for clarification.
5. Review the plan and answer any questions the agent has asked.

   You can iterate multiple times to clarify requirements, adjust scope, or answer questions.
6. Once the plan is complete you can:

   - Click **Start Implementation** to switch Copilot Chat to agent mode and start an agent session to implement the required changes, based on the implementation plan.
   - Click **Open in Editor** to switch Copilot Chat to agent mode and start an agent session that generates Markdown, in a tab of your editor, with the details of the implementation plan. You can start to work through the plan yourself, or save the plan as a Markdown file for later use.
