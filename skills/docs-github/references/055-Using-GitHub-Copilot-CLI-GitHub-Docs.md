# Using GitHub Copilot CLI

Learn how to use GitHub Copilot from the command line.

## Who can use this feature?

GitHub Copilot CLI is available with all Copilot plans. If you receive Copilot from an organization, the Copilot CLI policy must be enabled in the organization's settings.

The command-line interface (CLI) for GitHub Copilot allows you to use Copilot directly from your terminal. For more information, see [About GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/about-copilot-cli).

## [Prerequisite](#prerequisite)

Install Copilot CLI. See [Installing GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/set-up-copilot-cli/install-copilot-cli).

## [Using Copilot CLI](#using-copilot-cli)

1. In your terminal, navigate to a folder that contains code you want to work with.
2. Enter `copilot` to start Copilot CLI.

   Copilot will ask you to confirm that you trust the files in this folder.

   Important

   During this GitHub Copilot CLI session, Copilot may attempt to read, modify, and execute files in and below this folder. You should only proceed if you trust the files in this location. For more information about trusted directories, see [About GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/about-copilot-cli#trusted-directories).
3. Choose one of the options:

   **1. Yes, proceed**:

   Copilot can work with the files in this location for this session only.

   **2. Yes, and remember this folder for future sessions**:

   You trust the files in this folder for this and future sessions. You won't be asked again when you start Copilot CLI from this folder. Only choose this option if you are sure that it will always be safe for Copilot to work with files in this location.

   **3. No, exit (Esc)**:

   End your Copilot CLI session.
4. If you are not currently logged in to GitHub, you'll be prompted to use the `/login` slash command. Enter this command and follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate.
5. Enter a prompt in the CLI.

   This can be a simple chat question, or a request for Copilot to perform a specific task, such as fixing a bug, adding a feature to an existing application, or creating a new application.

   As an alternative to typing, you can speak your prompt. See [Use voice input with Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli/voice-input).

   For some examples of prompts, see [About GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/about-copilot-cli).
6. When Copilot wants to use a tool that could modify or execute files—for example, `touch`, `chmod`, `node`, or `sed`—it will ask you to approve the use of the tool.

   Choose one of the options:

   **1. Yes**:

   Allow Copilot to use this tool. The next time Copilot wants to use this tool, it will ask you to approve it again.

   **2. Yes, and approve TOOL for the rest of the running session**:

   Allow Copilot to use this tool—with any options—without asking again, for the rest of the currently running session. Any pending parallel permission requests of the same type will be auto-approved. You will have to approve the command again in future sessions.

   Choosing this option is useful for many tools—such as `chmod`—as it avoids you having to approve similar commands repeatedly in the same session. However, be aware of the security implications of this option. For example, choosing this option for the command `rm` would allow Copilot to delete any file in the current directory or its subdirectories without asking for your approval.

   **3. No, and tell Copilot what to do differently (Esc)**:

   Copilot will not run the command. Instead, it ends the current operation and awaits your next prompt. You can tell Copilot to continue the task but using a different approach.

   For example, if you ask Copilot to create a bash script but you do not want to use the script Copilot suggests, you can stop the current operation and enter a new prompt, such as: `Continue the previous task but include usage instructions in the script`.

   When you reject a tool permission request, you can also give Copilot inline feedback about the rejection so it can adapt its approach without stopping entirely.

## [Tips](#tips)

Optimize your experience with Copilot CLI with the following tips.

### [Stop a currently running operation](#stop-a-currently-running-operation)

If you enter a prompt and then decide you want to stop Copilot from completing the task while it is still "Thinking," press `Esc`.

### [Use plan mode](#use-plan-mode)

Plan mode lets you collaborate with Copilot on an implementation plan before any code is written. Press `Shift`+`Tab` to cycle in and out of plan mode.

### [Include a specific file in your prompt](#include-a-specific-file-in-your-prompt)

To add a specific file to your prompt, use `@` followed by the relative path to the file. For example: `Explain @config/ci/ci-required-checks.yml` or `Fix the bug in @src/app.js`. This adds the contents of the file to your prompt as context for Copilot.

When you start typing a file path, the matching paths are displayed below the prompt box. Use the arrow keys to select a path and press `Tab` to complete the path in your prompt.

### [Attach images and PDFs](#attach-images-and-pdfs)

You can attach images and PDFs to your prompts when using a model that supports image input.

Copilot supports the following file types:

- JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
- PNG (`.png`)
- GIF (`.gif`)
- WEBP (`.webp`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- HEIC (`.heic`)
- HEIF (`.heif`)

Image and PDF attachments are available on all Copilot plans and are enabled by default, with no policy required to turn the feature on or off.

You can attach a file in the following ways during an interactive session:

- Reference the file in your prompt using `@` followed by the path to the file.
- Drag and drop a file into the interactive session.
- Copy an image to your clipboard, then paste it as an attachment.

### [Work with files in a different location](#work-with-files-in-a-different-location)

To complete a task, Copilot may need to work with files that are outside the current working directory. If a prompt you have entered in an interactive session requires Copilot to modify a file outside the current location, it will ask you to approve access to the file's directory.

You can also add a trusted directory manually at any time by using the slash command:

```
/add-dir /path/to/directory
```

If all of the files you want to work with are in a different location, you can switch the current working directory without starting a new Copilot CLI session by using either the `/cwd` or `/cd` slash commands:

```
/cwd /path/to/directory
```

### [Run shell commands](#run-shell-commands)

You can prepend your input with `!` to directly run shell commands, without making a call to the model.

```
!git clone https://github.com/github/copilot-cli
```

### [Schedule prompts to run later](#schedule-prompts-to-run-later)

You can schedule prompts to run in the future using the `/every` and `/after` slash commands. The `/every` command schedules a prompt to run repeatedly at a specified interval, while the `/after` command schedules a one-shot prompt to run once after a specified delay. For example:

```
/every 1h Run frontend tests and report any failures
```

For more information, see [Scheduling prompts in GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/automate-copilot-cli/schedule-prompts).

### [Resume an interactive session](#resume-an-interactive-session)

You can use the `--resume` command-line option or the `/resume` slash command to select and resume an interactive CLI session, allowing you to pick up right where you left off, with the saved context. You can kick off a Copilot cloud agent session on GitHub, and then use GitHub Copilot CLI to bring that session to your local environment.

Tip

To quickly resume the most recently closed local session, enter this in your terminal:

```
copilot --continue
```

### [Use custom instructions](#use-custom-instructions)

You can enhance Copilot’s performance, by adding custom instructions to the repository you are working in. Custom instructions are natural language descriptions saved in Markdown files in the repository. They are automatically included in prompts you enter while working in that repository. This helps Copilot to better understand the context of your project and how to respond to your prompts.

Copilot CLI supports:

- Repository-wide instructions in the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.
- Path-specific instructions files: `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md`.
- Agent files such as `AGENTS.md`.

For more information, see [Adding custom instructions for GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions).

### [Use custom agents](#use-custom-agents)

A custom agent is a specialized version of Copilot. Custom agents help Copilot handle unique workflows, particular coding conventions, and specialist use cases.

Copilot CLI includes a default group of custom agents for common tasks:

| Agent | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Explore | Performs quick codebase analysis, allowing you to ask questions about your code without adding to your main context. |
| Task | Executes commands such as tests and builds, providing brief summaries on success and full output on failure. |
| General purpose | Handles complex, multi-step tasks that require the full toolset and high-quality reasoning, running in a separate context to keep your main conversation clearly focused. |
| Code review | Reviews changes with a focus on surfacing only genuine issues, minimizing noise. |
| Research | Performs deep research across your codebase, relevant repositories, and the web, producing a detailed report with citations. |
| Rubber duck | Acts as a constructive critic to provide feedback on some non-trivial tasks. Used automatically by Copilot CLI. |

The AI model being used by the CLI can choose to delegate a task to a subsidiary subagent process, that operates using a custom agent with specific expertise, if it judges that this would result in the work being completed more effectively. The model may equally choose to handle the work directly in the main agent.

Some built-in custom agents, such as the rubber duck agent, are consulted automatically by Copilot on your behalf rather than invoked by you directly. You won't see them as separate options when you run `/agent`, but you may see Copilot mention them as it works through a task.

You can define your own custom agents using Markdown files, called agent profiles, that specify what expertise the agent should have, what tools it can use, and any specific instructions for how it should respond.

You can define custom agents at the user, repository, or organization/enterprise level:

| Type | Location | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User-level custom agent | local `~/.copilot/agents` directory | All projects |
| Repository-level custom agent | `.github/agents` directory in your local and remote repositories | Current project |
| Organization and Enterprise-level custom agent | `/agents` directory in the `.github-private` repository in an organization or enterprise | All projects under your organization and enterprise account |

In the case of naming conflicts, a system-level agent overrides a repository-level agent, and the repository-level agent would override an organization-level agent.

Custom agents can be used in three ways:

- Using the slash command in the CLI's interactive interface to select from the list of available custom agents:

  ```
  /agent
  ```
- Calling out to custom agent directly in a prompt:

  ```
  Use the refactoring agent to refactor this code block
  ```

  Copilot will automatically infer the agent you want to use.
- Specifying the custom agent you want to use with the command-line option. For example:

  ```
  copilot --agent=refactor-agent --prompt "Refactor this code block"
  ```

For more information, see [Creating custom agents for Copilot cloud agent](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/create-custom-agents).

### [Use skills](#use-skills)

You can create skills to enhance the ability of Copilot to perform specialized tasks with instructions, scripts, and resources.

For more information, see [Adding agent skills for GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/add-skills).

### [Use hooks](#use-hooks)

You can use hooks to extend and customize the behavior of Copilot CLI. Hooks allow you to run custom shell commands automatically at key points during a CLI session.

For more information, see [Using hooks with GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/use-hooks).

### [Add an MCP server](#add-an-mcp-server)

Copilot CLI comes with the GitHub MCP server already configured. This MCP server allows you to interact with resources on GitHub.com—for example, allowing you to merge pull requests from the CLI.

To extend the functionality available to you in Copilot CLI, you can add more MCP servers:

1. Use the following slash command:

   ```
   /mcp add
   ```
2. Fill in the details for the MCP server you want to add, using the `Tab` key to move between fields.
3. Press `Ctrl`+`S` to save the details.

Details of your configured MCP servers are stored in the `mcp-config.json` file, which is located, by default, in the `~/.copilot` directory. This location can be changed by setting the `COPILOT_HOME` environment variable. For information about the JSON structure of a server definition, see [Configure MCP servers for your repository](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/configure-mcp-servers#writing-a-json-configuration-for-mcp-servers).

### [Context management](#context-management)

Copilot CLI provides several slash commands to help you monitor and manage your context window:

- `/usage`: Lets you view your session statistics, including:

  - The amount of GitHub AI Credits used in the current session
  - The session duration
  - The total lines of code edited
  - A breakdown of token usage per model
- `/context`: Provides a visual overview of your current token usage
- `/compact`: Manually compresses your conversation history to free up context space

GitHub Copilot CLI automatically compresses your history in the background when your conversation approaches 95% of the token limit, without interrupting your workflow.

### [Enable all permissions](#enable-all-permissions)

For situations where you trust Copilot to run freely, you can use the `--allow-all` or `--yolo` flags to enable all permissions at once.

### [Run in a sandbox](#run-in-a-sandbox)

You can run Copilot CLI sessions inside a sandbox to restrict access to your filesystem, network, and system capabilities. To enable local sandboxing, enter `/sandbox enable` inside a session. To start a cloud-backed session instead, run `copilot --cloud`. For more information, see [About cloud and local sandboxes for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/concepts/about-cloud-and-local-sandboxes).

### [Toggle reasoning visibility](#toggle-reasoning-visibility)

Press `Ctrl`+`T` to show or hide the model's reasoning process while it generates a response. This setting persists across sessions, allowing you to observe how Copilot works through complex problems.

### [Configure settings](#configure-settings)

You can view and change your personal Copilot CLI settings using the `/settings` slash command.

- Run `/settings` to open an interactive settings editor, where you can search for a setting by name and edit it. To restore a setting to its default value, highlight it in the list of settings and press `Ctrl`+`R`.
- Run `/settings KEY VALUE` to change a setting directly in the CLI's prompt box. KEY is the name of the setting and VALUE is the value you want to set. This also works in scripts and in programmatic sessions started with `-p`.
- Run `/settings show KEY` to display a setting's current value as text, without opening the editor.

Most settings changes take effect immediately, without needing to restart Copilot CLI.

For more information, see [Changing settings with the /settings command](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/change-settings). For the full list of available settings, see [GitHub Copilot CLI configuration directory](/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-config-dir-reference#configuration-file-settings).

## [Find out more](#find-out-more)

For a complete list of the command line options and slash commands that you can use with Copilot CLI, do one of the following:

- Enter `?` in the prompt box in an interactive session.
- Enter `copilot help` in your terminal.

For additional information, use one of the following `copilot help` subcommands in your terminal:

- **Configuration settings**:

  `copilot help config`
- **Environment variables** that affect Copilot CLI:

  `copilot help environment`
- **Available logging levels**:

  `copilot help logging`
- **Permissions** for allowing or denying tool use:

  `copilot help permissions`

## [Feedback](#feedback)

If you have any feedback about GitHub Copilot CLI, please let us know by using the `/feedback` slash command in an interactive session and choosing one of the options. You can complete a private feedback survey, submit a bug report, or suggest a new feature.

## [Next steps](#next-steps)

Copilot CLI can operate as a conversational assistant, answering questions and helping you write code interactively. Beyond chat, Copilot CLI supports a range of agentic modes that allow you to delegate tasks with greater autonomy.

You can work with agents in Copilot CLI to support a full task lifecycle, from delegating work to reviewing results:

- **Delegate tasks autonomously**: Run Copilot CLI in autopilot mode to complete multi-step tasks without requiring approval at each step. See [Delegating tasks to Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli/delegate-tasks-to-cca).
- **Invoke custom agents**: Invoke specialized agents tailored to specific tasks, such as code review, documentation, or security audits. See [Invoking custom agents](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli/invoke-custom-agents).
- **Steer agents**: Guide and refine agent behavior during task execution to keep work on track. See [Steering agents in GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli/steer-agents).
- **Request a code review**: Use Copilot CLI to get an AI-powered review of your code changes. See [Requesting a code review with GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli/agentic-code-review).
