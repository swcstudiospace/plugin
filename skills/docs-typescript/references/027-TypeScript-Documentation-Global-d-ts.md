## Global Libraries

A *global* library is one that can be accessed from the global scope (i.e. without using any form of `import`).
Many libraries simply expose one or more global variables for use.
For example, if you were using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), the `$` variable can be used by simply referring to it:

```
ts

$(() => {

console.log("hello!");

});
```

You’ll usually see guidance in the documentation of a global library of how to use the library in an HTML script tag:

```
html

<script src="http://a.great.cdn.for/someLib.js"></script>
```

Today, most popular globally-accessible libraries are actually written as UMD libraries (see below).
UMD library documentation is hard to distinguish from global library documentation.
Before writing a global declaration file, make sure the library isn’t actually UMD.

## Identifying a Global Library from Code

Global library code is usually extremely simple.
A global “Hello, world” library might look like this:

```
js

function createGreeting(s) {

return "Hello, " + s;

}
```

or like this:

```
js

window.createGreeting = function (s) {

return "Hello, " + s;

};
```

When looking at the code of a global library, you’ll usually see:

- Top-level `var` statements or `function` declarations
- One or more assignments to `window.someName`
- Assumptions that DOM primitives like `document` or `window` exist

You *won’t* see:

- Checks for, or usage of, module loaders like `require` or `define`
- CommonJS/Node.js-style imports of the form `var fs = require("fs");`
- Calls to `define(...)`
- Documentation describing how to `require` or import the library

## Examples of Global Libraries

Because it’s usually easy to turn a global library into a UMD library, very few popular libraries are still written in the global style.
However, libraries that are small and require the DOM (or have *no* dependencies) may still be global.

## Global Library Template

You can see an example DTS below:

```
ts

// Type definitions for [~THE LIBRARY NAME~] [~OPTIONAL VERSION NUMBER~]

// Project: [~THE PROJECT NAME~]

// Definitions by: [~YOUR NAME~] <[~A URL FOR YOU~]>

/*~ If this library is callable (e.g. can be invoked as myLib(3)),

*~ include those call signatures here.

*~ Otherwise, delete this section.

*/

declare function myLib(a: string): string;

declare function myLib(a: number): number;

/*~ If you want the name of this library to be a valid type name,

*~ you can do so here.

*~

*~ For example, this allows us to write 'var x: myLib';

*~ Be sure this actually makes sense! If it doesn't, just

*~ delete this declaration and add types inside the namespace below.

*/

interface myLib {

name: string;

length: number;

extras?: string[];

}

/*~ If your library has properties exposed on a global variable,

*~ place them here.

*~ You should also place types (interfaces and type alias) here.

*/

declare namespace myLib {

//~ We can write 'myLib.timeout = 50;'

let timeout: number;

//~ We can access 'myLib.version', but not change it

const version: string;

//~ There's some class we can create via 'let c = new myLib.Cat(42)'

//~ Or reference e.g. 'function f(c: myLib.Cat) { ... }

class Cat {

constructor(n: number);

//~ We can read 'c.age' from a 'Cat' instance

readonly age: number;

//~ We can invoke 'c.purr()' from a 'Cat' instance

purr(): void;

}

//~ We can declare a variable as

//~   'var s: myLib.CatSettings = { weight: 5, name: "Maru" };'

interface CatSettings {

weight: number;

name: string;

tailLength?: number;

}

//~ We can write 'const v: myLib.VetID = 42;'

//~  or 'const v: myLib.VetID = "bob";'

type VetID = string | number;

//~ We can invoke 'myLib.checkCat(c)' or 'myLib.checkCat(c, v);'

function checkCat(c: Cat, s?: VetID);

}
```
