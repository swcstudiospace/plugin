# Global: Modifying Module

## *Global-modifying Modules*

A *global-modifying module* alters existing values in the global scope when they are imported.
For example, there might exist a library which adds new members to `String.prototype` when imported.
This pattern is somewhat dangerous due to the possibility of runtime conflicts,
but we can still write a declaration file for it.

## Identifying global-modifying modules

Global-modifying modules are generally easy to identify from their documentation.
In general, they’re similar to global plugins, but need a `require` call to activate their effects.

You might see documentation like this:

```
js

// 'require' call that doesn't use its return value

var unused = require("magic-string-time");

/* or */

require("magic-string-time");

var x = "hello, world";

// Creates new methods on built-in types

console.log(x.startsWithHello());

var y = [1, 2, 3];

// Creates new methods on built-in types

console.log(y.reverseAndSort());
```

Here is an example

```
ts

// Type definitions for [~THE LIBRARY NAME~] [~OPTIONAL VERSION NUMBER~]

// Project: [~THE PROJECT NAME~]

// Definitions by: [~YOUR NAME~] <[~A URL FOR YOU~]>

/*~ This is the global-modifying module template file. You should rename it to index.d.ts

*~ and place it in a folder with the same name as the module.

*~ For example, if you were writing a file for "super-greeter", this

*~ file should be 'super-greeter/index.d.ts'

*/

/*~ Note: If your global-modifying module is callable or constructable, you'll

*~ need to combine the patterns here with those in the module-class or module-function

*~ template files

*/

declare global {

/*~ Here, declare things that go in the global namespace, or augment

*~ existing declarations in the global namespace

*/

interface String {

fancyFormat(opts: StringFormatOptions): string;

}

}

/*~ If your module exports types or values, write them as usual */

export interface StringFormatOptions {

fancinessLevel: number;

}

/*~ For example, declaring a method on the module (in addition to its global side effects) */

export function doSomething(): void;

/*~ If your module exports nothing, you'll need this line. Otherwise, delete it */

export {};
```
