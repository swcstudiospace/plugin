# Deploy Popover
## Overview
The Deploy Popover component provides a user-friendly popover interface for deploying files to Vercel. It includes real-time deployment status tracking, error handling, and the ability to inspect or visit deployments once they're ready.
## Installation
Install the `deploy-popover` block into your project using the Platform Elements installer.
## Features
- \*\*One-click deployment\*\*: Simple button interface to trigger deployments
- \*\*Real-time status tracking\*\*: Monitor deployment progress with live updates
- \*\*Deployment states\*\*: Clear visual feedback for deploying, building, ready, and error states
- \*\*Direct deployment access\*\*: Links to inspect deployments during build or visit when ready
- \*\*Error handling\*\*: Graceful error state management with user feedback
- \*\*Automatic polling\*\*: Built-in SWR polling for deployment status updates
## Usage
```tsx filename="deploy-popover.tsx"
import { DeployPopover } from '@/components/blocks/deploy-popover';
export default function MyComponent() {
return ();
}
```
## Component states
The component manages several deployment states:
### Idle
Initial state before any deployment action. Shows "Deploy to Vercel" button.
### Deploying
Active deployment in progress. Shows "Inspect Deployment" link.
### Polling
Checking deployment status after initial deployment. Shows progress messages like "Building application..." or "Initializing deployment..."
### Ready
Deployment successfully completed. Shows "Visit Deployment" link.
### Error
Deployment failed. Shows error message with option to inspect the failed deployment.
## Customization
### Custom files
You can customize the files being deployed by modifying the `files` array:
```tsx filename="deploy-popover.tsx"
const files = [
{
file: 'index.html',
data: '

# Your custom content

',
},
{
file: 'style.css',
data: 'body { font-family: system-ui; }',
},
] satisfies InlinedFile[];
```
### Project configuration
Set a specific Vercel project ID for deployments:
```tsx filename="deploy-popover.tsx"
const [projectId, setProjectId] = useState(
'your-project-id-here',
);
```
### Deployment name
Customize the deployment name in the `deployFiles` call:
```tsx filename="deploy-popover.tsx"
deployFiles(arg.paths, {
projectId: arg.projectId ?? undefined,
deploymentName: 'your-custom-deployment-name',
});
```
## Integration with Deploy Files action
This component works seamlessly with the Deploy Files server action:
```tsx filename="deploy-popover.tsx"
import { deployFiles, getDeploymentStatus } from '@/actions/deploy-files';
// Deploy files to Vercel
const result = await deployFiles(files, {
projectId: projectId ?? undefined,
deploymentName: 'platforms-deploy-test',
});
// Check deployment status
const status = await getDeploymentStatus(deploymentId);
```
## Polling configuration
The component uses SWR for automatic status polling with these defaults:
- \*\*Refresh interval\*\*: 10 seconds
- \*\*Error retry count\*\*: 3 attempts
- \*\*Error retry interval\*\*: 2 seconds
You can adjust these in the `useSWR` configuration:
```tsx filename="deploy-popover.tsx"
const REFRESH\_INTERVAL = 10\_000; // 10 seconds
useSWR(deploymentId, getDeploymentStatus, {
refreshInterval: REFRESH\_INTERVAL,
errorRetryCount: 3,
errorRetryInterval: 2000,
});
```
