# TanStack Start on Vercel
TanStack Start is a fullstack framework powered by TanStack Router for React and Solid. It has support for full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling and more. TanStack Start works great on Vercel when paired with [Nitro](https://v3.nitro.build/).
## Getting started
You can quickly deploy a TanStack Start application to Vercel by creating a new one below or configuring an existing one with Nitro:
## Nitro Configuration
The [Nitro Vite plugin](https://v3.nitro.build/) allows deploying TanStack Start apps on Vercel, and integrates with Vercel's features.
To set up Nitro in your TanStack app, navigate to the root directory of your TanStack Start project with your terminal and install `nitro` with your preferred package manager:
```` ```bash
pnpm i nitro
``` ````
```` ```bash
yarn i nitro
``` ````
```` ```bash
npm i nitro
``` ````
```` ```bash
bun i nitro
``` ````
To configure Nitro with TanStack Start, add the following lines to your `vite.config` file:
```ts {4-4,9-9} filename="/vite.config.ts"
import { tanstackStart } from '@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import viteReact from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { nitro } from 'nitro/vite';
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [tanstackStart(), nitro(), viteReact()],
});
```
### Vercel Functions
TanStack Start apps on Vercel benefit from the advantages of [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions) and use [Fluid Compute](/docs/fluid-compute) by default. This means your TanStack Start app will automatically scale up and down based on traffic.
## Lovable
[Lovable](https://lovable.dev) projects use TanStack Start as their underlying framework, so they deploy to Vercel with zero configuration. Lovable uses [Nitro](https://v3.nitro.build/), the same universal server toolkit that powers TanStack Start on Vercel, so no manual build configuration is required.
To deploy a Lovable project to Vercel:
1. Sync your Lovable project to GitHub. See the [Lovable GitHub integration docs](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/github) for setup.
2. Import the repository from [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new). Vercel detects the framework and deploys the project automatically.
Once connected, every change you make in Lovable syncs to GitHub and triggers a new deployment on Vercel.
> \*\*💡 Note:\*\* Zero-configuration detection requires `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` version `^2.6.2` or higher in your project. If your project uses an older version, update it before deploying.
