# Reasoning
Reasoning models work through a problem before answering. With the [OpenResponses API](/docs/ai-gateway/sdks-and-apis/openresponses), set the `reasoning` object to control how much thinking the model does. AI Gateway translates it to each provider's native reasoning configuration, so the same request shape works across providers.
#### \['cURL'
```bash filename="reasoning.sh"
curl -X POST "https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/responses" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $AI\_GATEWAY\_API\_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"model": "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
"input": [
{
"type": "message",
"role": "user",
"content": "A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much is the ball?"
}
],
"reasoning": {
"effort": "high"
}
}'
```
#### 'TypeScript'
```typescript filename="reasoning.ts" {17-19}
const apiKey = process.env.AI\_GATEWAY\_API\_KEY;
const response = await fetch('https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/responses', {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
},
body: JSON.stringify({
model: 'openai/gpt-5.6-sol',
input: [
{
type: 'message',
role: 'user',
content: 'A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much is the ball?',
},
],
reasoning: {
effort: 'high',
},
}),
});
const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.usage.output\_tokens\_details.reasoning\_tokens);
```
#### 'Python']
```python filename="reasoning.py" {19-21}
import os
import requests
api\_key = os.environ["AI\_GATEWAY\_API\_KEY"]
response = requests.post(
"https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/responses",
headers={
"Content-Type": "application/json",
"Authorization": f"Bearer {api\_key}",
},
json={
"model": "openai/gpt-5.6-sol",
"input": [
{
"type": "message",
"role": "user",
"content": "A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much is the ball?",
}
],
"reasoning": {
"effort": "high",
},
},
)
result = response.json()
print(result["usage"]["output\_tokens\_details"]["reasoning\_tokens"])
```
## Effort levels
`reasoning.effort` controls how much the model thinks before answering. Higher effort costs more tokens and takes longer:
| Level | Use it for |
| ----- | ---------- |
| `low` | Simple tasks and latency-sensitive work |
| `medium` | A balance of speed and depth |
| `high` | Complex reasoning, difficult coding, agentic tasks |
Which levels a model accepts varies. See [Reasoning](/docs/ai-gateway/models-and-providers/reasoning) for the per-provider support matrix, including the levels above and below these three that some models add.
## Reasoning summaries
Set `reasoning.summary` to `auto` to ask for a readable summary of the model's thinking alongside the answer:
```json
{
"reasoning": {
"effort": "low",
"summary": "auto"
}
}
```
## Reading the response
Thinking appears in two places. The `output` array carries a `reasoning` item before the answer message, and `usage` reports how many tokens went to thinking:
```typescript
const result = await response.json();
const reasoning = result.output.find((item) => item.type === 'reasoning');
const message = result.output.find((item) => item.type === 'message');
console.log(result.usage.output\_tokens\_details.reasoning\_tokens);
console.log(message.content[0].text);
```
> \*\*💡 Note:\*\* The raw chain of thought isn't returned. A `reasoning` item may carry an
> `encrypted\_content` field rather than readable text, so treat it as an opaque
> value to pass back rather than something to display. Use `summary: "auto"`
> when you want text you can show.
## Next steps
- [Reasoning](/docs/ai-gateway/models-and-providers/reasoning) - Per-provider configuration and the full effort reference
- [Structured outputs](/docs/ai-gateway/sdks-and-apis/openresponses/structured-outputs) - Constrain the answer to a schema
- [Streaming](/docs/ai-gateway/sdks-and-apis/openresponses/streaming) - Stream tokens as they're generated
