# Restrict access to deployments with Passport
> \*\*🔒 Permissions Required\*\*: Passport
Passport lets you protect deployments with your own identity provider. Visitors authenticate with your identity provider before they can view a protected deployment.
Use Passport when you want visitors to sign in with an external identity provider, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, or another OpenID Connect compatible provider. Vercel Connect stores the OAuth application configuration that talks to your identity provider.
## How Passport works
Passport has two parts:
- \*\*Vercel Connect application\*\*: The OAuth or OpenID Connect configuration that stores your identity provider's issuer, endpoints, client ID, and client secret.
- \*\*Project or team setting\*\*: The Passport configuration that selects the Connect application and controls whether Passport is enabled.
When a visitor opens a protected deployment, Vercel redirects them to your identity provider. After the identity provider authenticates the visitor, Vercel validates the response and sets a session cookie for the protected deployment.

## Guides
\*\*Set up Passport with an identity provider\*\*: Configure Passport for Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and other OIDC providers. [Learn more →](/docs/passport/set-up-identity-provider)
\*\*Configure additional identity scopes\*\*: Request group membership and other provider-specific identity claims. [Learn more →](/docs/passport/additional-identity-scopes)
\*\*Read Passport identity in your application\*\*: Read a verified visitor identity from route handlers, server actions, and server components. [Learn more →](/docs/passport/read-identity)
\*\*Passport token claims\*\*: Review the standard, deployment, and visitor identity claims in a Passport token. [Learn more →](/docs/passport/token-claims)
\*\*Verify forwarded Passport tokens\*\*: Verify a forwarded token as a signed JWT. [Learn more →](/docs/passport/verify-identity)
\*\*Forward Passport identity to another backend\*\*: Pass a Passport token to a backend you operate over HTTPS. [Learn more →](/docs/passport/forward-identity)
## Monitor Passport access
When a visitor successfully authenticates to a Passport-protected project, Vercel records a `passport-access-granted` event in both the [Activity Log](/dashboard/activity?types=passport-access-granted) and [Audit Logs](/docs/audit-log). The event identifies the visitor and records the protected hostname and project context.
In the Activity Log, select \*\*Filter by Event\*\*, then select \*\*passport-access-granted\*\* to view Passport access events.

Send the bypass secret with the original request because Passport runs before deployment routes and Next.js proxy functions.
