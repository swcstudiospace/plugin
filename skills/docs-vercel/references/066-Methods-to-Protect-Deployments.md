# Methods to Protect Deployments
Vercel offers several methods for protecting your deployments. Depending on your use case, you can choose to protect a single environment, or multiple environments. See [Understanding Deployment Protection by environment](/docs/deployment-protection#choose-which-urls-to-protect) for more information.
To see an overview of your projects' protections:
1. Open \*\*Settings\*\* in the sidebar of your [dashboard](/dashboard) and select [\*\*Deployment Protection\*\*](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fdeployment-protection\&title=Go+to+Deployment+Protection+settings)

## Vercel Authentication
> \*\*🔒 Permissions Required\*\*: Vercel Authentication
With Vercel Authentication you can restrict access to all deployments (including non-public deployments), meaning only team members with a Vercel account, or users you share a [Sharable Link](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection#sharable-links) with, can access non-public URLs, such as `my-project-1234-your-name.vercel.app`.
When a Vercel user visits your protected deployment but doesn't have permission to access it, they can [request access](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication#access-requests) for their Vercel account. This request triggers an email and Vercel notification to the branch authors.
Learn more about [Vercel Authentication](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication) and how to enable it.
## Passport
> \*\*🔒 Permissions Required\*\*: Passport
Passport restricts access to visitors who authenticate through your identity provider. Use Passport when you want to protect deployments with an OpenID Connect compatible provider, such as Okta or Auth0.
Learn more about [Passport](/docs/passport) and how to enable it.
## Password Protection
> \*\*🔒 Permissions Required\*\*: Password Protection
Password Protection on Vercel lets you restrict access to both non-public, and public deployments depending on the type of [environment protection](/docs/deployment-protection#choose-which-urls-to-protect) you choose.
Learn more about [Password Protection](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection) and how to enable it.
## Trusted IPs
> \*\*🔒 Permissions Required\*\*: Trusted IPs
Trusted IPs restrict deployment access to specified IPv4 addresses and [CIDR ranges](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr "What are CIDR ranges?"), returning a 404 for unauthorized IPs. This protection feature is suitable for limiting access through specific paths like VPNs or external proxies.
Learn more about [Trusted IPs](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips) and how to enable it.
