# Getting started with Vercel
Deploy your app on Vercel in three steps: install the CLI, add agent support if you use an AI coding agent, and deploy.
## Prerequisites
- A [Vercel account](/signup)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
## Install the Vercel CLI
Every Vercel workflow starts with the CLI. Install it whether or not you use an AI coding agent. Agents that can run terminal commands use the CLI to deploy, pull environment variables, and manage projects.
- ### Install Vercel CLI
```` ```bash
pnpm i vercel
``` ````
```` ```bash
yarn i vercel
``` ````
```` ```bash
npm i vercel
``` ````
```` ```bash
bun i vercel
``` ````
- ### Log in to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```
Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Vercel account.
- ### Deploy your project
Navigate to your project directory and run:
```bash
vercel
```
The CLI detects your framework, builds your project, and deploys it. To deploy to production:
```bash
vercel --prod
```
See the [CLI documentation](/docs/cli) for the full command reference.
## Install the Vercel Plugin
If you use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), install the [Vercel Plugin](https://github.com/vercel/vercel-plugin). It gives your agent deployment skills, framework best practices, and slash commands like `/vercel-plugin:deploy prod` and `/vercel-plugin:env`.
```bash
npx plugins add vercel/vercel-plugin
```
The plugin activates automatically. No configuration needed.
See the [Vercel Plugin documentation](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-plugin) for the full list of skills, specialist agents, and slash commands.
## Install Vercel Skills for other agents
If you use Cline, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, or any of the 18+ agents supported by [Skills.sh](https://skills.sh), install Vercel Skills instead. Skills give your agent the same deployment and framework expertise in a format compatible with your tool.
```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
```
To install a specific skill:
```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill vercel-react-best-practices
```
See [Agent Skills](/docs/agent-resources/skills) for the full list.
## Add a database or other storage
If your project needs a database, blob storage, or another backing service, you can provision one from the CLI and have Vercel wire the credentials into your project automatically.
Run [`vercel install`](/docs/cli/install) (alias for [`vercel integration add`](/docs/cli/integration#vercel-integration-add)) to install a Marketplace integration, provision a resource, connect it to the currently linked project, and sync environment variables into `.env.local`:
```bash
vercel install neon
vercel install upstash
vercel install supabase
```
Add `--help` to any command to see integration-specific products, metadata options, and billing plans. For non-interactive flows, pass options as flags:
```bash
vercel install neon --name my-database --plan free -e production -e preview
```
See [Storage on Vercel Marketplace](/docs/marketplace-storage) for the full list of storage integrations.
## Deploy from the dashboard
You can also deploy without the CLI. Go to the [New Project](/new) page, connect your [GitHub](/docs/git/vercel-for-github), [GitLab](/docs/git/vercel-for-gitlab), or [Bitbucket](/docs/git/vercel-for-bitbucket) account, select a repo, and click \*\*Deploy\*\*. Every push to your connected branch triggers a new deployment automatically.
