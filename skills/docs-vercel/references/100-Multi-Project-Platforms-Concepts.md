# Multi-Project Platforms Concepts
## Projects
### What is a project
A Vercel project represents a single application with its own Git repository, environment variables, and deployment history. In multi-project architecture, each tenant gets their own dedicated Vercel project.
\*\*Key characteristics\*\*:
- Unique project ID
- Independent configuration
- Separate deployment history
- Isolated builds and functions
### Programmatic creation
Create projects using the Vercel SDK:
```ts filename="create-project.ts"
import { Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk';
const vercel = new Vercel({
bearerToken: '',
});
const { value: project } = await vercel.projects.createProject({
teamId: 'team\_1234',
requestBody: {
name: `tenant-${tenantId}`,
framework: 'nextjs',
},
});
```
### Project templates
Generate projects from templates to ensure consistency:
```ts filename="create-project-from-template.ts"
import { Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk';
const vercel = new Vercel({
bearerToken: '',
});
const { value: project } = await vercel.projects.createProject({
teamId: 'team\_1234',
requestBody: {
name: `tenant-${tenantId}`,
gitRepository: {
type: 'github',
repo: 'your-org/tenant-template',
},
},
});
```
## Deployments
### Isolated deployments
Each project has independent deployments:
- Separate build processes
- Independent function execution
- Isolated environment variables
- Individual deployment URLs
### Deployment lifecycle
1. \*\*Create\*\*: Deploy code to project
2. \*\*Build\*\*: Vercel builds the application
3. \*\*Preview\*\*: Test deployment before promoting
4. \*\*Production\*\*: Promote deployment to production
5. \*\*Rollback\*\*: Revert to previous deployment if needed
### Preview vs production
\*\*Preview deployments\*\*:
- Generated for every Git push
- Unique URL per deployment
- Test changes before production
\*\*Production deployments\*\*:
- Live on project domains
- Promoted from preview or direct deploy
- Serves end users
## Domains
### Per-project domains
Each tenant project can have its own domains:
```ts filename="add-domain.ts"
import { Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk';
const vercel = new Vercel({
bearerToken: '',
});
await vercel.projects.addProjectDomain({
idOrName: project.id,
requestBody: {
name: 'tenant1.com',
},
});
```
### Automatic URLs
Every project gets automatic Vercel URLs:
- Production: `project-name.vercel.app`
- Preview: `project-name-git-branch.vercel.app`
### Custom domains per project
Configure custom domains independently for each tenant:
- Add domain via SDK
- Tenant configures DNS
- Verify ownership
- SSL certificate issues automatically
## Architecture
### Multiple projects vs single project
\*\*Multi-Project\*\*:
- Each tenant = separate Vercel project
- Complete isolation
- Independent scaling
- Higher management overhead
\*\*Multi-Tenant\*\* (single project):
- All tenants = one Vercel project
- Shared infrastructure
- Lower management overhead
- Application-level isolation
## Use cases
### When to use Multi-Project vs Multi-Tenant
\*\*Use Multi-Project when\*\*:
- Tenants deploy their own code
- Each tenant needs custom functionality
- Complete isolation is required (security, compliance)
- AI agents are generating and deploying code
- Users create applications from templates
\*\*Use Multi-Tenant when\*\*:
- All tenants use the same application
- Content differs but code is the same
- You want to deploy once, update all tenants
- Lower operational overhead preferred
### AI coding platforms
Perfect for platforms where:
- AI generates unique code per tenant
- Each tenant's app is different
- Users can deploy custom logic
- Examples: Spawn, Orchids, v0
### Template-based platforms
Ideal for:
- Creating projects from templates
- Customizing per tenant
- Maintaining consistency
- Rapid tenant onboarding
### User-generated applications
Well-suited for:
- Users creating their own apps
- Hosting user-generated content
- Platform controls infrastructure
- Users focus on their code
