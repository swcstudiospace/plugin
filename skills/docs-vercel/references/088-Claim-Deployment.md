# Claim Deployment
## Overview
The Claim Deployment block provides a polished interface for platforms that deploy sites to Vercel on behalf of their users. When you create a deployment programmatically (e.g., through Mintlify, Hashnode, or similar platforms), users can claim ownership to manage updates and settings directly from their own Vercel account.
## Installation
Install the `claim-deployment` block into your project using the Platform Elements installer.
## Features
- \*\*Visual deployment preview\*\*: Shows a preview image of the deployed site
- \*\*One-click URL copying\*\*: Users can easily copy their deployment URL with the external link button
- \*\*Vercel branding\*\*: Includes the official Vercel logo for authenticity
- \*\*Responsive design\*\*: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
## Usage
```tsx filename="claim-deployment.tsx"
import { ClaimDeployment } from '@/components/blocks/claim-deployment';
export default function DeploymentReady() {
const handleClaim = () => {
// Redirect to Vercel OAuth flow or handle claim logic
window.location.href = `https://vercel.com/oauth/authorize?...`;
};
return (
);
}
```
## Props
| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url` | `string` | Yes | The deployment URL to display and allow copying |
| `onClaimClick` | `() => void` | Yes | Callback function triggered when the "Claim Deployment" button is clicked |
## Customization
The component uses shadcn/ui components internally, allowing you to customize the appearance through your existing theme configuration. Replace the preview image placeholder with an actual screenshot of the deployment.
## Integration flow
1. \*\*Deploy via API\*\*: Your platform creates a deployment using Vercel's API
2. \*\*Show claim interface\*\*: Present this component to the user with their deployment URL
3. \*\*Handle claim action\*\*: When clicked, redirect to Vercel's OAuth flow or your custom claim process
4. \*\*Transfer ownership\*\*: Complete the transfer so users can manage the deployment from their Vercel dashboard
