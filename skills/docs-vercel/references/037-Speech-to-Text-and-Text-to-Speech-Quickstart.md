# Speech to Text and Text to Speech Quickstart
Text to speech and speech to text are two halves of the same workflow: one turns text into spoken audio, the other turns audio back into text. They feed into each other, so this quickstart runs both as a round-trip. You generate speech from a sentence, then transcribe that audio and check the text comes back.
> \*\*💡 Note:\*\* Speech and transcription support in the AI Gateway provider is available on
> the canary releases of the AI SDK. Install them with `pnpm add ai@canary
> @ai-sdk/gateway@canary`.
- ### Set up your project
Create a new directory and initialize a Node.js project:
```bash filename="Terminal"
mkdir ai-speech-demo
cd ai-speech-demo
pnpm init
```
- ### Install dependencies
Install the canary AI SDK, the AI Gateway provider, and development dependencies:
#### npm
```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install ai@canary @ai-sdk/gateway@canary dotenv @types/node tsx typescript
```
#### yarn
```bash filename="Terminal"
yarn add ai@canary @ai-sdk/gateway@canary dotenv @types/node tsx typescript
```
#### pnpm
```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm add ai@canary @ai-sdk/gateway@canary dotenv @types/node tsx typescript
```
#### bun
```bash filename="Terminal"
bun add ai@canary @ai-sdk/gateway@canary dotenv @types/node tsx typescript
```
- ### Set up your API key
Go to the [AI Gateway API Keys page](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai-gateway%2Fapi-keys\&title=AI+Gateway+API+Keys) in your Vercel dashboard and click \*\*Create key\*\* to generate a new API key.
Create a `.env.local` file and save your API key:
```bash filename=".env.local"
AI\_GATEWAY\_API\_KEY=your\_ai\_gateway\_api\_key
```
> \*\*💡 Note:\*\* Instead of using an API key, you can use [OIDC
> tokens](/docs/ai-gateway/authentication-and-byok#oidc-token-authentication) to
> authenticate your requests.
- ### Run the round-trip
Create an `index.ts` file. It generates speech from a sentence, saves the audio, then transcribes that same audio back to text:
```typescript filename="index.ts"
import {
experimental\_generateSpeech as generateSpeech,
experimental\_transcribe as transcribe,
} from 'ai';
import { gateway } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import 'dotenv/config';
async function main() {
const text = 'Thanks for trying out AI Gateway.';
// Text to speech
const speech = await generateSpeech({
model: gateway.speechModel('openai/tts-1'),
text,
voice: 'alloy',
outputFormat: 'mp3',
});
await writeFile('speech.mp3', speech.audio.uint8Array);
console.log('Saved speech.mp3');
// Speech to text: transcribe the audio we just generated
const transcript = await transcribe({
model: gateway.transcriptionModel('openai/whisper-1'),
audio: speech.audio.uint8Array,
});
console.log('Transcript:', transcript.text);
}
main().catch(console.error);
```
Run your script:
```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm tsx index.ts
```
You get `speech.mp3` with the spoken sentence, and the transcript prints back the text you started with.
- ### Next steps
- Read the [Text to Speech reference](/docs/ai-gateway/modalities/text-to-speech) for voices, formats, and the full list of request options
- Read the [Speech to Text reference](/docs/ai-gateway/modalities/speech-to-text) for segments, timestamps, and provider options
- For live, two-way voice conversations, follow the [Realtime quickstart](/docs/ai-gateway/getting-started/realtime)
## Use each on its own
The two calls are independent. Use `experimental\_generateSpeech` alone to add voiceovers or spoken responses, and `experimental\_transcribe` alone to transcribe recordings, voice notes, or call audio. You can also call the REST endpoints directly without the AI SDK; see the [Text to Speech](/docs/ai-gateway/modalities/text-to-speech#generate-speech-with-the-rest-api) and [Speech to Text](/docs/ai-gateway/modalities/speech-to-text#transcribe-with-the-rest-api) references.
