# AI SDK for Python
The [AI SDK for Python](https://ai-python.dev) is a toolkit for building LLM-powered applications and agents in Python.
It uses AI Gateway to route requests by default.
> \*\*💡 Note:\*\* The AI SDK for Python is in public beta.
## Installation
The SDK requires Python 3.12 or later. Install the `ai` package:
#### uv
```bash filename="Terminal"
uv add ai
```
#### pip
```bash filename="Terminal"
pip install ai
```
## Quick start
Create a model with a string model ID and pass it to `ai.stream` to get a streaming response.
You can omit the provider prefix or use `gateway:` to route through AI Gateway.
```python filename="quickstart.py"
import asyncio
import ai
async def main() -> None:
model = ai.get\_model('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6')
messages = [ai.user\_message('Explain quantum computing in one paragraph.')]
async with ai.stream(model, messages) as stream:
async for event in stream:
if isinstance(event, ai.events.TextDelta):
print(event.chunk, end='', flush=True)
asyncio.run(main())
```
Responses always stream. After iteration, the full response is available on `stream.text`, and token counts on `stream.usage`.
## Structured outputs
Pass a [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/docs/validation/latest/concepts/models/) model as `output\_type` to get validated,
structured data. After the stream finishes, `stream.output` returns an instance of your model:
```python filename="structured.py"
import asyncio
import ai
import pydantic
class Person(pydantic.BaseModel):
name: str
age: int
city: str
async def main() -> None:
model = ai.get\_model('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6')
messages = [
ai.user\_message('Extract: John is 30 years old and lives in NYC.')
]
async with ai.stream(model, messages, output\_type=Person) as stream:
async for event in stream:
pass
print(stream.output) # Person(name='John', age=30, city='NYC')
asyncio.run(main())
```
## Tool calling with agents
Define tools as Python functions with the `@ai.tool` decorator.
An `ai.Agent` runs a loop: it streams model output and executes requested tools until the model returns a final answer.
```python filename="agent.py"
import asyncio
import ai
@ai.tool
async def get\_weather(city: str) -> str:
"""Get the current weather for a city."""
return 'Sunny, 72F'
async def main() -> None:
model = ai.get\_model('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6')
agent = ai.Agent(tools=[get\_weather])
messages = [ai.user\_message("What's the weather in Tokyo?")]
async with agent.run(model, messages) as stream:
async for event in stream:
if isinstance(event, ai.events.TextDelta):
print(event.chunk, end='', flush=True)
history = stream.messages # Full conversation, including tool results
asyncio.run(main())
```
The function signature and docstring become the tool schema. The model sees the tool name, description, and typed parameters.
## Authentication
The SDK can use `AI\_GATEWAY\_API\_KEY` environment variable to authenticate:
```bash filename="Terminal"
export AI\_GATEWAY\_API\_KEY="your\_ai\_gateway\_api\_key"
```
When deploying to Vercel or using `vercel dev` for local development, you are encouraged to use [OIDC](/docs/ai-gateway/authentication-and-byok/oidc) instead of an API key.
Install the `vercel` extra and the SDK will handle authentication automatically:
```bash filename="Terminal"
uv add "ai[vercel]"
```
See [Authentication](/docs/ai-gateway/authentication-and-byok) for more details.
