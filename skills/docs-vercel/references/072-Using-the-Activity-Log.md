# Using the Activity Log
> \*\*🔒 Permissions Required\*\*: Activity Log
The [Activity Log](/dashboard/activity) provides a list of all events on a [team](/docs/accounts#teams), chronologically organized since its creation. These events include:
- User(s) involved with the event
- Type of event performed
- Type of account
- Time of the event (hover over the time to reveal the exact timestamp)
> \*\*💡 Note:\*\* Vercel does not emit any logs to third-party services. The Activity Log is
> only available to the account owner and team members.

\*Example events list on the Activity page.\*
## When to use the Activity log
Common use cases for viewing the Activity log include:
- If a user was removed or deleted by mistake, use the list to find when the event happened and who requested it
- A domain can be disconnected from your deployment. Use the list to see if a domain related event was recently triggered
- Check if a specific user was removed from a team
## When to use Audit Logs
Enterprise team owners can use [Audit Logs](/docs/audit-log) for security review, CSV exports, and external audit storage. Audit Logs include Activity Log events and additional audit metadata.
## CLI access
You can also view and filter activity events from the command line. See the [`vercel activity`](/docs/cli/activity) CLI reference for available options.
